\v 1 “‘If anyone sins, in that he hears a public adjuration to testify, he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if hedoesn’t report it, then he shall bear his iniquity. 
\v 2 “‘Or if anyone touches any unclean thing, whether it is the carcass of an unclean animal, or the carcass of uncleanlivestock, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and it is hidden from him, and he is unclean, then he shall be guilty.
\v 3 “‘Or if he touches the uncleanness of man, whatever his uncleanness is with which he is unclean, and it is hidden fromhim; when he knows of it, then he shall be guilty. 
\v 4 “‘Or if anyone swears rashly with his lips to do evil or to do good—whatever it is that a man might utter rashly with anoath, and it is hidden from him—when he knows of it, then he will be guilty of one of these.
\v 5 It shall be, when he is guilty of one of these, he shall confess that in which he has sinned;
\v 6 and he shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh for his sin which he has sinned: a female from the flock, a lamb or agoat, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin.

\v 9 He shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall bedrained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering. 
\v 10 He shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for himconcerning his sin which he has sinned, and he shall be forgiven.
\v 11 “‘But if he can’t afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he shall bring as his offering for that in which hehas sinned, one tenth of an ephah\f + \fr 5:11 \ft 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of abushel\f* of fine flour for a sin offering. He shall put no oil on it, and he shall not put any frankincense on it, for it is asin offering. 
\v 12 He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial portion, and burn it on thealtar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. It is a sin offering.
\v 13 The priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin that he has sinned in any of these things, and he will beforgiven; and the rest shall be the priest’s, as the meal offering.’”
\v 14 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 15 “If anyone commits a trespass, and sins unwittingly regarding Yahweh’s holy things, then he shall bring his trespassoffering to Yahweh: a ram without defect from the flock, according to your estimation in silver by shekels, according to theshekel\f + \fr 5:15 \ft A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35ounces.\f* of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering. 
\v 16 He shall make restitution for that which he has done wrong regarding the holy thing, and shall add a fifth part to it,and give it to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and he will beforgiven. 
\v 17 “If anyone sins, doing any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, though he didn’t know it, he is stillguilty, and shall bear his iniquity. 
\v 18 He shall bring a ram without defect from of the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass offering, to thepriest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing in which he sinned and didn’t know it, and he will beforgiven. 
\v 19 It is a trespass offering. He is certainly guilty before Yahweh.”
\c 6 
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 “If anyone sins, and commits a trespass against Yahweh, and deals falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or ofbargain, or of robbery, or has oppressed his neighbor, 
\v 3 or has found that which was lost, and lied about it, and swearing to a lie—in any of these things that a man sins in hisactions— 
\v 4 then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which hehas gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found,
\v 5 or any thing about which he has sworn falsely: he shall restore it in full, and shall add a fifth part more to it. Heshall return it to him to whom it belongs in the day of his being found guilty.
\v 6 He shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh: a ram without defect from the flock, according to your estimation, for atrespass offering, to the priest. 
\v 7 The priest shall make atonement for him before Yahweh, and he will be forgiven concerning whatever he does to becomeguilty.”

\v 9 “Command Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the burnt offering: the burnt offering shall be on the hearth onthe altar all night until the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it.
\v 10 The priest shall put on his linen garment, and he shall put on his linen trousers upon his body; and he shall remove theashes from where the fire has consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
\v 11 He shall take off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
\v 12 The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it everymorning. He shall lay the burnt offering in order upon it, and shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings.
\v 13 Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.
\v 14 “‘This is the law of the meal offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before Yahweh, before the altar.
\v 15 He shall take from there his handful of the fine flour of the meal offering, and of its oil, and all the frankincensewhich is on the meal offering, and shall burn it on the altar for a pleasant aroma, as its memorial portion, to Yahweh.
\v 16 That which is left of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten without yeast in a holy place. They shall eat itin the court of the Tent of Meeting. 
\v 17 It shall not be baked with yeast. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire. It is most holy, as arethe sin offering and the trespass offering. 
\v 18 Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as their portion forever throughout your generations, from theofferings of Yahweh made by fire. Whoever touches them shall be holy.’”
\v 19 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 20 “This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to Yahweh in the day when he is anointed: onetenth of an ephah\f + \fr 6:20 \ft 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of abushel\f* of fine flour for a meal offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening.
\v 21 It shall be made with oil in a griddle. When it is soaked, you shall bring it in. You shall offer the meal offering inbaked pieces for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. 
\v 22 The anointed priest that will be in his place from among his sons shall offer it. By a statute forever, it shall bewholly burned to Yahweh. 
\v 23 Every meal offering of a priest shall be wholly burned. It shall not be eaten.”
\v 24 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 25 “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering iskilled, the sin offering shall be killed before Yahweh. It is most holy.
\v 26 The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting.
\v 27 Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be holy. When there is any of its blood sprinkled on a garment, you shall wash thaton which it was sprinkled in a holy place. 
\v 28 But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken; and if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it shall bescoured, and rinsed in water. 
\v 29 Every male among the priests shall eat of it. It is most holy.
\v 30 No sin offering, of which any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place, shallbe eaten. It shall be burned with fire. 
\c 7 
\v 1 “‘This is the law of the trespass offering: It is most holy.
\v 2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering, he shall kill the trespass offering; and its blood he shall sprinklearound on the altar. 
\v 3 He shall offer all of its fat: the fat tail, and the fat that covers the innards,
\v 4 and he shall take away the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver,with the kidneys; 
\v 5 and the priest shall burn them on the altar for an offering made by fire to Yahweh: it is a trespass offering.
\v 6 Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. It is most holy.
\v 7 “‘As is the sin offering, so is the trespass offering; there is one law for them. The priest who makes atonement with themshall have it. 
\v 8 The priest who offers any man’s burnt offering shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered.
\v 9 Every meal offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is prepared in the pan and on the griddle, shall be thepriest’s who offers it. 
\v 10 Every meal offering, mixed with oil or dry, belongs to all the sons of Aaron, one as well as another.
\v 11 “‘This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which one shall offer to Yahweh:
\v 12 If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mixed withoil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mixed with oil.
\v 13 He shall offer his offering with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving with cakes of leavened bread.
\v 14 Of it he shall offer one out of each offering for a heave offering to Yahweh. It shall be the priest’s who sprinkles theblood of the peace offerings. 
\v 15 The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering. He shallnot leave any of it until the morning. 
\v 16 “‘But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow, or a free will offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers hissacrifice. On the next day what remains of it shall be eaten, 
\v 17 but what remains of the meat of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.
\v 18 If any of the meat of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted, and itshall not be credited to him who offers it. It will be an abomination, and the soul who eats any of it will bear his iniquity.
\v 19 “‘The meat that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned with fire. As for the meat, everyone whois clean may eat it; 
\v 20 but the soul who eats of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings that belongs to Yahweh, having his uncleanness onhim, that soul shall be cut off from his people. 
\v 21 When anyone touches any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean animal, or any unclean abomination, and eatssome of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to Yahweh, that soul shall be cut off from his people.’”
\v 22 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 23 “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘You shall eat no fat, of bull, or sheep, or goat.
\v 24 The fat of that which dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of animals, may be used for any other service,but you shall in no way eat of it. 
\v 25 For whoever eats the fat of the animal which men offer as an offering made by fire to Yahweh, even the soul who eats itshall be cut off from his people. 
\v 26 You shall not eat any blood, whether it is of bird or of animal, in any of your dwellings.
\v 27 Whoever it is who eats any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.’”
\v 28 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 29 “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to Yahweh shall bring hisoffering to Yahweh out of the sacrifice of his peace offerings. 
\v 30 With his own hands he shall bring the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. He shall bring the fat with the breast, that thebreast may be waved for a wave offering before Yahweh. 
\v 31 The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.
\v 32 The right thigh you shall give to the priest for a heave offering out of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
\v 33 He among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for aportion. 
\v 34 For the waved breast and the heaved thigh I have taken from the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peaceofferings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their portion forever from the children of Israel.’”
\v 35 This is the consecrated portion of Aaron, and the consecrated portion of his sons, out of the offerings of Yahweh made byfire, in the day when he presented them to minister to Yahweh in the priest’s office;
\v 36 which Yahweh commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them. It is their portionforever throughout their generations. 
\v 37 This is the law of the burnt offering, the meal offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, the consecration, andthe sacrifice of peace offerings 
\v 38 which Yahweh commanded Moses in Mount Sinai in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their offeringsto Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai.

\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 “Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering, and the tworams, and the basket of unleavened bread; 
\v 3 and assemble all the congregation at the door of the Tent of Meeting.”
\v 4 Moses did as Yahweh commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
\v 5 Moses said to the congregation, “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded to be done.”
\v 6 Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
\v 7 He put the tunic on him, tied the sash on him, clothed him with the robe, put the ephod on him, and he tied the skillfullywoven band of the ephod on him and fastened it to him with it. 
\v 8 He placed the breastplate on him. He put the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate.
\v 9 He set the turban on his head. He set the golden plate, the holy crown, on the front of the turban, as Yahweh commandedMoses. 
\v 10 Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and sanctified them.
\v 11 He sprinkled it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the basin and its base, tosanctify them. 
\v 12 He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
\v 13 Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics, and tied sashes on them, and put headbands on them, as Yahwehcommanded Moses. 
\v 14 He brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sinoffering. 
\v 15 He killed it; and Moses took the blood, and put it around on the horns of the altar with his finger, and purified thealtar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.
\v 16 He took all the fat that was on the innards, and the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Mosesburned it on the altar. 
\v 17 But the bull, and its skin, and its meat, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 18 He presented the ram of the burnt offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
\v 19 He killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar.
\v 20 He cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burned the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
\v 21 He washed the innards and the legs with water; and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for apleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 22 He presented the other ram, the ram of consecration. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
\v 23 He killed it; and Moses took some of its blood, and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and on the thumb of his righthand, and on the great toe of his right foot. 
\v 24 He brought Aaron’s sons; and Moses put some of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their righthand, and on the great toe of their right foot; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar.
\v 25 He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat that was on the innards, the cover of the liver, the two kidneys and theirfat, and the right thigh; 
\v 26 and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before Yahweh, he took one unleavened cake, one cake of oiled bread,and one wafer, and placed them on the fat and on the right thigh.
\v 27 He put all these in Aaron’s hands and in his sons’ hands, and waved them for a wave offering before Yahweh.
\v 28 Moses took them from their hands, and burned them on the altar on the burnt offering. They were a consecration offeringfor a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
\v 29 Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before Yahweh. It was Moses’ portion of the ram of consecration,as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
\v 30 Moses took some of the anointing oil, and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on hisgarments, and on his sons, and on his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons’garments with him. 
\v 31 Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and there eat it and the breadthat is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’
\v 32 What remains of the meat and of the bread you shall burn with fire.
\v 33 You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your consecration arefulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days. 
\v 34 What has been done today, so Yahweh has commanded to do, to make atonement for you.
\v 35 You shall stay at the door of the Tent of Meeting day and night seven days, and keep Yahweh’s command, that you don’tdie: for so I am commanded.” 
\v 36 Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh commanded by Moses.
\c 9 
\v 1 On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
\v 2 and he said to Aaron, “Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without defect, andoffer them before Yahweh. 
\v 3 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both ayear old, without defect, for a burnt offering; 
\v 4 and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today Yahwehappears to you.’” 
\v 5 They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting. All the congregation came near and stood before Yahweh.
\v 6 Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you should do; and Yahweh’s glory shall appear to you.”
\v 7 Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement foryourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Yahweh commanded.”
\v 8 So Aaron came near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
\v 9 The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar,and poured out the blood at the base of the altar; 
\v 10 but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar, as Yahwehcommanded Moses. 
\v 11 The meat and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.
\v 12 He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar.
\v 13 They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head. He burned them upon the altar.
\v 14 He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar.
\v 15 He presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, andoffered it for sin, like the first. 
\v 16 He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.
\v 17 He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, in addition to the burntoffering of the morning. 
\v 18 He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people. Aaron’s sons deliveredto him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar; 
\v 19 and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the coverof the liver; 
\v 20 and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar.
\v 21 Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh for a wave offering before Yahweh, as Moses commanded.
\v 22 Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and theburnt offering, and the peace offerings. 
\v 23 Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and Yahweh’s glory appeared to allthe people. 
\v 24 Fire came out from before Yahweh, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar. When all the people saw it,they shouted, and fell on their faces. 
\c 10 
\v 1 Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strangefire before Yahweh, which he had not commanded them. 
\v 2 Fire came out from before Yahweh, and devoured them, and they died before Yahweh.
\v 3 Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what Yahweh spoke of, saying, ‘I will show myself holy to those who come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified.’” Aaron held his peace. 
\v 4 Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Draw near, carry yourbrothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.” 
\v 5 So they came near, and carried them in their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said.
\v 6 Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Don’t let the hair of your heads go loose, and don’t tearyour clothes, so that you don’t die, and so that he will not be angry with all the congregation; but let your brothers, thewhole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Yahweh has kindled.
\v 7 You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you.” Theydid according to the word of Moses. 
\v 8 Then Yahweh said to Aaron, 
\v 9 “You and your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink whenever you go into the Tent of Meeting, or you will die. Thisshall be a statute forever throughout your generations. 
\v 10 You are to make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean.
\v 11 You are to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Yahweh has spoken to them by Moses.”
\v 12 Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, “Take the meal offering that remains of theofferings of Yahweh made by fire, and eat it without yeast beside the altar; for it is most holy;
\v 13 and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion, and your sons’ portion, of the offerings of Yahweh madeby fire; for so I am commanded. 
\v 14 The waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you:for they are given as your portion, and your sons’ portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children ofIsrael. 
\v 15 The heaved thigh and the waved breast they shall bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a waveoffering before Yahweh. It shall be yours, and your sons’ with you, as a portion forever, as Yahweh has commanded.”
\v 16 Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and,behold,\f + \fr 10:16 \ft “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used asan interjection.\f* it was burned. He was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,
\v 17 “Why haven’t you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is most holy, and he has given it to youto bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Yahweh?
\v 18 Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly should have eaten it in thesanctuary, as I commanded.” 
\v 19 Aaron spoke to Moses, “Behold, today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before Yahweh; andsuch things as these have happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing in Yahweh’ssight?” 
\v 20 When Moses heard that, it was pleasing in his sight. 
\c 11 
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them, 
\v 2 “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘These are the living things which you may eat among all the animals that are onthe earth. 
\v 3 Whatever parts the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and chews the cud among the animals, that you may eat.

\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 “When a man shall have a swelling in his body’s skin, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes in the skin of his bodythe plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests.
\v 3 The priest shall examine the plague in the skin of the body. If the hair in the plague has turned white, and theappearance of the plague is deeper than the body’s skin, it is the plague of leprosy; so the priest shall examine him andpronounce him unclean. 
\v 4 If the bright spot is white in the skin of his body, and its appearance isn’t deeper than the skin, and its hair hasn’tturned white, then the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days.
\v 5 The priest shall examine him on the seventh day. Behold, if in his eyes the plague is arrested and the plague hasn’tspread in the skin, then the priest shall isolate him for seven more days.
\v 6 The priest shall examine him again on the seventh day. Behold, if the plague has faded and the plague hasn’t spread in theskin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. It is a scab. He shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
\v 7 But if the scab spreads on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself tothe priest again. 
\v 8 The priest shall examine him; and behold, if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean.It is leprosy. 
\v 9 “When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest;
\v 10 and the priest shall examine him. Behold, if there is a white swelling in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, andthere is raw flesh in the swelling, 
\v 11 it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He shall not isolate him,for he is already unclean. 
\v 12 “If the leprosy breaks out all over the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of the infected person from his headeven to his feet, as far as it appears to the priest, 
\v 13 then the priest shall examine him. Behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean of theplague. It has all turned white: he is clean.

\v 38 “When a man or a woman has bright spots in the skin of the body, even white bright spots,
\v 39 then the priest shall examine them. Behold, if the bright spots on the skin of their body are a dull white, it is aharmless rash. It has broken out in the skin. He is clean. 
\v 40 “If a man’s hair has fallen from his head, he is bald. He is clean.

\v 42 But if a reddish-white plague is in the bald head or the bald forehead, it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head orhis bald forehead. 
\v 43 Then the priest shall examine him. Behold, if the swelling of the plague is reddish-white in his bald head, or in hisbald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body,

\v 24 The priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a waveoffering before Yahweh. 
\v 25 He shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering. The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and putit on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of hisright foot.

\v 32 This is the law for him in whom is the plague of leprosy, who is not able to afford the sacrifice for his cleansing.
\v 33 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 34 “When you have come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put a spreading mildew in ahouse in the land of your possession, 
\v 35 then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, ‘There seems to me to be some sort of plague in thehouse.’ 
\v 36 The priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goes in to examine the plague, that all that is inthe house not be made unclean. Afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house.
\v 37 He shall examine the plague; and behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish orreddish, and it appears to be deeper than the wall, 
\v 38 then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.
\v 39 The priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look. If the plague has spread in the walls of the house,
\v 40 then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the plague, and cast them into an unclean placeoutside of the city. 
\v 41 He shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped all over. They shall pour out the mortar that they scraped offoutside of the city into an unclean place. 
\v 42 They shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shallplaster the house. 
\v 43 “If the plague comes again, and breaks out in the house after he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped thehouse, and after it was plastered, 
\v 44 then the priest shall come in and look; and behold, if the plague has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew inthe house. It is unclean. 
\v 45 He shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the house’s mortar. He shall carry them out of thecity into an unclean place. 
\v 46 “Moreover he who goes into the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.
\v 47 He who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
\v 48 “If the priest shall come in, and examine it, and behold, the plague hasn’t spread in the house, after the house wasplastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
\v 49 To cleanse the house he shall take two birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop.
\v 50 He shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.
\v 51 He shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird,and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times. 
\v 52 He shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, with the living bird, with the cedarwood, with the hyssop, and with the scarlet; 
\v 53 but he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field. So shall he make atonement for the house; and itshall be clean.” 
\v 54 This is the law for any plague of leprosy, and for an itch,
\v 55 and for the destructive mildew of a garment, and for a house,
\v 56 and for a swelling, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;
\v 57 to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean. This is the law of leprosy.

\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they came near before Yahweh, and died;

\v 3 “Aaron shall come into the sanctuary with a young bull for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.
\v 4 He shall put on the holy linen tunic. He shall have the linen trousers on his body, and shall put on the linen sash, andhe shall be clothed with the linen turban. They are the holy garments. He shall bathe his body in water, and put them on.

\v 12 He shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Yahweh, and two handfuls of sweet incense beatensmall, and bring it within the veil. 
\v 13 He shall put the incense on the fire before Yahweh, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is on thecovenant, so that he will not die. 
\v 14 He shall take some of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east; and beforethe mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.

\v 16 He shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of theirtransgressions, even all their sins; and so he shall do for the Tent of Meeting that dwells with them in the middle of theiruncleanness. 
\v 17 No one shall be in the Tent of Meeting when he enters to make atonement in the Holy Place, until he comes out, and hasmade atonement for himself and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.

\v 4 and hasn’t brought it to the door of the Tent of Meeting to offer it as an offering to Yahweh before Yahweh’s tabernacle:blood shall be imputed to that man. He has shed blood. That man shall be cut off from among his people.
\v 5 This is to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, thatthey may bring them to Yahweh, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peaceofferings to Yahweh. 
\v 6 The priest shall sprinkle the blood on Yahweh’s altar at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and burn the fat for a pleasantaroma to Yahweh.

\v 11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood. I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for itis the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life. 
\v 12 Therefore I have said to the children of Israel, “No person among you may eat blood, nor may any stranger who lives as aforeigner among you eat blood.” 
\v 13 “‘Whatever man there is of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them, who takes inhunting any animal or bird that may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood, and cover it with dust.
\v 14 For as to the life of all flesh, its blood is with its life. Therefore I said to the children of Israel, “You shall noteat the blood of any kind of flesh; for the life of all flesh is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.”
\v 15 “‘Every person that eats what dies of itself, or that which is torn by animals, whether he is native-born or a foreigner,shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. Then he shall be clean.
\v 16 But if he doesn’t wash them, or bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.’”

\v 18 “‘If a man lies with a woman having her monthly period, and uncovers her nakedness, he has made her fountain naked, andshe has uncovered the fountain of her blood. Both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
\v 19 “‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, nor of your father’s sister, for he has made his closerelative naked. They shall bear their iniquity. 
\v 20 If a man lies with his uncle’s wife, he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness. They shall bear their sin. They shall diechildless. 
\v 21 “‘If a man takes his brother’s wife, it is an impurity. He has uncovered his brother’s nakedness. They shall bechildless. 
\v 22 “‘You shall therefore keep all my statutes and all my ordinances, and do them, that the land where I am bringing you todwell may not vomit you out. 
\v 23 You shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I am casting out before you; for they did all these things, andtherefore I abhorred them. 
\v 24 But I have said to you, “You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milkand honey.” I am Yahweh your God, who has separated you from the peoples.
\v 25 “‘You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and theclean. You shall not make yourselves abominable by animal, or by bird, or by anything with which the ground teems, which I haveseparated from you as unclean for you. 
\v 26 You shall be holy to me, for I, Yahweh, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that you should be mine.
\v 27 “‘A man or a woman that is a medium or is a wizard shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones. Theirblood shall be upon themselves.’” 
\c 21 
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, ‘A priest shall not defile himself forthe dead among his people, 
\v 2 except for his relatives that are near to him: for his mother, for his father, for his son, for his daughter, for hisbrother, 
\v 3 and for his virgin sister who is near to him, who has had no husband; for her he may defile himself.
\v 4 He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
\v 5 “‘They shall not shave their heads or shave off the corners of their beards or make any cuttings in their flesh.
\v 6 They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God, for they offer the offerings of Yahweh made byfire, the bread of their God. Therefore they shall be holy. 
\v 7 “‘They shall not marry a woman who is a prostitute, or profane. A priest shall not marry a woman divorced from herhusband; for he is holy to his God. 
\v 8 Therefore you shall sanctify him, for he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to you, for I Yahweh, who sanctifyyou, am holy. 
\v 9 “‘The daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by playing the prostitute, she profanes her father. She shall beburned with fire. 
\v 10 “‘He who is the high priest among his brothers, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and who is consecrated toput on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head hang loose, or tear his clothes.
\v 11 He must not go in to any dead body, or defile himself for his father or for his mother.
\v 12 He shall not go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his Godis upon him. I am Yahweh. 
\v 13 “‘He shall take a wife in her virginity. 
\v 14 He shall not marry a widow, or one divorced, or a woman who has been defiled, or a prostitute. He shall take a virgin ofhis own people as a wife. 
\v 15 He shall not profane his offspring among his people, for I am Yahweh who sanctifies him.’”
\v 16 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 17 “Say to Aaron, ‘None of your offspring throughout their generations who has a defect may approach to offer the bread ofhis God. 
\v 18 For whatever man he is that has a defect, he shall not draw near: a blind man, or a lame, or he who has a flat nose, orany deformity, 
\v 19 or a man who has an injured foot, or an injured hand, 
\v 20 or hunchbacked, or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye, or an itching disease, or scabs, or who has damagedtesticles. 
\v 21 No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a defect shall come near to offer the offerings of Yahweh made byfire. Since he has a defect, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.
\v 22 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.
\v 23 He shall not come near to the veil, nor come near to the altar, because he has a defect; that he may not profane mysanctuaries, for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.’” 
\v 24 So Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel.
\c 22 
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 “Tell Aaron and his sons to separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they make holy tome, and that they not profane my holy name. I am Yahweh. 
\v 3 “Tell them, ‘If anyone of all your offspring throughout your generations approaches the holy things which the children ofIsrael make holy to Yahweh, having his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut off from before me. I am Yahweh.
\v 4 “‘Whoever of the offspring of Aaron is a leper or has a discharge shall not eat of the holy things until he is clean.Whoever touches anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man who has a seminal emission,
\v 5 or whoever touches any creeping thing whereby he may be made unclean, or a man from whom he may become unclean, whateveruncleanness he has— 
\v 6 the person that touches any such shall be unclean until the evening, and shall not eat of the holy things unless he batheshis body in water. 
\v 7 When the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.
\v 8 He shall not eat that which dies of itself or is torn by animals, defiling himself by it. I am Yahweh.
\v 9 “‘They shall therefore follow my commandment, lest they bear sin for it and die in it, if they profane it. I am Yahweh whosanctifies them. 
\v 10 “‘No stranger shall eat of the holy thing: a foreigner living with the priests, or a hired servant, shall not eat of theholy thing. 
\v 11 But if a priest buys a slave, purchased by his money, he shall eat of it; and those who are born in his house shall eatof his bread. 
\v 12 If a priest’s daughter is married to an outsider, she shall not eat of the heave offering of the holy things.
\v 13 But if a priest’s daughter is a widow, or divorced, and has no child, and has returned to her father’s house as in heryouth, she may eat of her father’s bread; but no stranger shall eat any of it.
\v 14 “‘If a man eats something holy unwittingly, then he shall add the fifth part of its value to it, and shall give the holything to the priest. 
\v 15 The priests shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer to Yahweh,
\v 16 and so cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt when they eat their holy things; for I am Yahweh who sanctifiesthem.’” 
\v 17 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 18 “Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, ‘Whoever is of the house of Israel,or of the foreigners in Israel, who offers his offering, whether it is any of their vows or any of their free will offerings,which they offer to Yahweh for a burnt offering: 
\v 19 that you may be accepted, you shall offer a male without defect, of the bulls, of the sheep, or of the goats.
\v 20 But you shall not offer whatever has a defect, for it shall not be acceptable for you.
\v 21 Whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh to accomplish a vow, or for a free will offering of the herd orof the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted. It shall have no defect.
\v 22 You shall not offer what is blind, is injured, is maimed, has a wart, is festering, or has a running sore to Yahweh, normake an offering by fire of them on the altar to Yahweh. 
\v 23 Either a bull or a lamb that has any deformity or lacking in his parts, that you may offer for a free will offering; butfor a vow it shall not be accepted. 
\v 24 You must not offer to Yahweh that which has its testicles bruised, crushed, broken, or cut. You must not do this in yourland. 
\v 25 You must not offer any of these as the bread of your God from the hand of a foreigner, because their corruption is inthem. There is a defect in them. They shall not be accepted for you.’”
\v 26 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 27 “When a bull, a sheep, or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother. From the eighth day on it shall beaccepted for the offering of an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
\v 28 Whether it is a cow or ewe, you shall not kill it and its young both in one day.
\v 29 “When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Yahweh, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.
\v 30 It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it until the morning. I am Yahweh.
\v 31 “Therefore you shall keep my commandments, and do them. I am Yahweh.
\v 32 You shall not profane my holy name, but I will be made holy among the children of Israel. I am Yahweh who makes you holy,
\v 33 who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I am Yahweh.”
\c 23 
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘The set feasts of Yahweh, which you shall proclaim to be holyconvocations, even these are my set feasts. 
\v 3 “‘Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; you shall do nokind of work. It is a Sabbath to Yahweh in all your dwellings. 
\v 4 “‘These are the set feasts of Yahweh, even holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed season.
\v 5 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, is Yahweh’s Passover.
\v 6 On the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to Yahweh. Seven days you shall eat unleavenedbread. 
\v 7 In the first day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work.
\v 8 But you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh seven days. In the seventh day is a holy convocation. You shall dono regular work.’” 
\v 9 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 10 “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reapits harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest.
\v 11 He shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh, to be accepted for you. On the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall waveit. 
\v 12 On the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb without defect a year old for a burnt offering to Yahweh.
\v 13 The meal offering with it shall be two tenths of an ephah\f + \fr 23:13 \ft 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel\f* of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to Yahweh fora pleasant aroma; and the drink offering with it shall be of wine, the fourth part of ahin.\f + \fr 23:13 \ft A hin is about 6.5 liters or 1.7 gallons.\f*
\v 14 You must not eat bread, or roasted grain, or fresh grain, until this same day, until you have brought the offering ofyour God. This is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\v 15 “‘You shall count from the next day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering:seven Sabbaths shall be completed. 
\v 16 The next day after the seventh Sabbath you shall count fifty days; and you shall offer a new meal offering to Yahweh.
\v 17 You shall bring out of your habitations two loaves of bread for a wave offering made of two tenths of anephah\f + \fr 23:17 \ft 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of abushel\f* of fine flour. They shall be baked with yeast, for first fruits to Yahweh.
\v 18 You shall present with the bread seven lambs without defect a year old, one young bull, and two rams. They shall be aburnt offering to Yahweh, with their meal offering and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet aromato Yahweh. 
\v 19 You shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
\v 20 The priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before Yahweh, with the two lambs. Theyshall be holy to Yahweh for the priest. 
\v 21 You shall make proclamation on the same day that there shall be a holy convocation to you. You shall do no regular work.This is a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
\v 22 “‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you must not wholly reap into the corners of your field, and you must notgather the gleanings of your harvest. You must leave them for the poor, and for the foreigner. I am Yahweh your God.’”
\v 23 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 24 “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, there shall be a solemnrest for you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.
\v 25 You shall do no regular work. You shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.’”
\v 26 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 27 “However on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement. It shall be a holy convocation to you. You shallafflict yourselves and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
\v 28 You shall do no kind of work in that same day, for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Yahweh yourGod. 
\v 29 For whoever it is who shall not deny himself in that same day shall be cut off from his people.
\v 30 Whoever does any kind of work in that same day, I will destroy that person from among his people.
\v 31 You shall do no kind of work: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\v 32 It shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall deny yourselves. In the ninth day of the month at evening,from evening to evening, you shall keep your Sabbath.” 
\v 33 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 34 “Speak to the children of Israel, and say, ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast ofbooths\f + \fr 23:34 \ft or, feast of tents, or Succoth\f* for seven days to Yahweh.
\v 35 On the first day shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work.
\v 36 Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh. On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you. Youshall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh. It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no regular work.
\v 37 “‘These are the appointed feasts of Yahweh which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made byfire to Yahweh, a burnt offering, a meal offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day—
\v 38 in addition to the Sabbaths of Yahweh, and in addition to your gifts, and in addition to all your vows, and in additionto all your free will offerings, which you give to Yahweh. 
\v 39 “‘So on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruits of the land, you shall keep thefeast of Yahweh seven days. On the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
\v 40 You shall take on the first day the fruit of majestic trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, andwillows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God seven days.
\v 41 You shall keep it as a feast to Yahweh seven days in the year. It is a statute forever throughout your generations. Youshall keep it in the seventh month. 
\v 42 You shall dwell in temporary shelters\f + \fr 23:42 \ft or,booths\f* for seven days. All who are native-born in Israel shall dwell in temporaryshelters,\f + \fr 23:42 \ft or, booths\f* 
\v 43 that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in temporaryshelters\f + \fr 23:43 \ft or, booths\f* when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.’”
\v 44 So Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed feasts of Yahweh.
\c 24 
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 “Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burncontinually. 
\v 3 Outside of the veil of the Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron shall keep it in order from evening to morning beforeYahweh continually. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
\v 4 He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold lamp stand before Yahweh continually.
\v 5 “You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenths of anephah\f + \fr 24:5 \ft 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of abushel\f* shall be in one cake. 
\v 6 You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold table before Yahweh.
\v 7 You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire toYahweh. 
\v 8 Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before Yahweh continually. It is an everlasting covenant on the behalf of thechildren of Israel. 
\v 9 It shall be for Aaron and his sons. They shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy to him of the offerings ofYahweh made by fire by a perpetual statute.” 
\v 10 The son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of theIsraelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp.
\v 11 The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. His mother’s name wasShelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. 
\v 12 They put him in custody until Yahweh’s will should be declared to them.
\v 13 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 14 “Bring him who cursed out of the camp; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all thecongregation stone him. 
\v 15 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.
\v 16 He who blasphemes Yahweh’s name, he shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly stone him. Theforeigner as well as the native-born shall be put to death when he blasphemes the Name.
\v 17 “‘He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death.
\v 18 He who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good, life for life.
\v 19 If anyone injures his neighbor, it shall be done to him as he has done:
\v 20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. It shall be done to him as he has injured someone.
\v 21 He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death.
\v 22 You shall have one kind of law for the foreigner as well as the native-born; for I am Yahweh your God.’”
\v 23 Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones.The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
\c 25 
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses in Mount Sinai, 
\v 2 “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the land which I give you, then the land shall keep aSabbath to Yahweh. 
\v 3 You shall sow your field six years, and you shall prune your vineyard six years, and gather in its fruits;
\v 4 but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to Yahweh. You shall not sow yourfield or prune your vineyard. 
\v 5 What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap, and you shall not gather the grapes of your undressed vine. Itshall be a year of solemn rest for the land. 
\v 6 The Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for yourself, for your servant, for your maid, for your hired servant,and for your stranger, who lives as a foreigner with you. 
\v 7 For your livestock also, and for the animals that are in your land, shall all its increase be for food.
\v 8 “‘You shall count off seven Sabbaths of years, seven times seven years; and there shall be to you the days of sevenSabbaths of years, even forty-nine years. 
\v 9 Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you shall sound thetrumpet throughout all your land. 
\v 10 You shall make the fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be ajubilee to you; and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family.
\v 11 That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you. In it you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself, norgather from the undressed vines. 
\v 12 For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat of its increase out of the field.
\v 13 “‘In this Year of Jubilee each of you shall return to his property.
\v 14 “‘If you sell anything to your neighbor, or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong one another.
\v 15 According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor. According to the number of years ofthe crops he shall sell to you. 
\v 16 According to the length of the years you shall increase its price, and according to the shortness of the years you shalldiminish its price; for he is selling the number of the crops to you.
\v 17 You shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am Yahweh your God.
\v 18 “‘Therefore you shall do my statutes, and keep my ordinances and do them; and you shall dwell in the land in safety.
\v 19 The land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
\v 20 If you said, “What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;”
\v 21 then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bear fruit for the three years.
\v 22 You shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits from the old store until the ninth year. Until its fruits come in,you shall eat the old store. 
\v 23 “‘The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; for you are strangers and live as foreigners with me.
\v 24 In all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.
\v 25 “‘If your brother becomes poor, and sells some of his possessions, then his kinsman who is next to him shall come, andredeem that which his brother has sold. 
\v 26 If a man has no one to redeem it, and he becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it,
\v 27 then let him reckon the years since its sale, and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it; and he shall returnto his property. 
\v 28 But if he isn’t able to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hand of him who has bought ituntil the Year of Jubilee. In the Jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his property.
\v 29 “‘If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it has been sold. Fora full year he shall have the right of redemption. 
\v 30 If it isn’t redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure inperpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations. It shall not be released in the Jubilee.
\v 31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall around them shall be accounted for with the fields of the country: theymay be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee. 
\v 32 “‘Nevertheless, in the cities of the Levites, the Levites may redeem the houses in the cities of their possession at anytime. 
\v 33 The Levites may redeem the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, and it shall be released in the Jubilee;for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
\v 34 But the field of the pasture lands of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession.
\v 35 “‘If your brother has become poor, and his hand can’t support himself among you, then you shall uphold him. He shall livewith you like an alien and a temporary resident. 
\v 36 Take no interest from him or profit; but fear your God, that your brother may live among you.
\v 37 You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.
\v 38 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.
\v 39 “‘If your brother has grown poor among you, and sells himself to you, you shall not make him to serve as a slave.
\v 40 As a hired servant, and as a temporary resident, he shall be with you; he shall serve with you until the Year of Jubilee.
\v 41 Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family, and to the possession ofhis fathers. 
\v 42 For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. They shall not be sold as slaves.
\v 43 You shall not rule over him with harshness, but shall fear your God.
\v 44 “‘As for your male and your female slaves, whom you may have from the nations that are around you, from them you may buymale and female slaves. 
\v 45 Moreover, of the children of the aliens who live among you, of them you may buy, and of their families who are with you,which they have conceived in your land; and they will be your property.
\v 46 You may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession. Of them you may take your slavesforever, but over your brothers the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with harshness.
\v 47 “‘If an alien or temporary resident with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him has grown poor, and sells himselfto the stranger or foreigner living among you, or to a member of the stranger’s family,
\v 48 after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him;
\v 49 or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him; orif he has grown rich, he may redeem himself. 
\v 50 He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the Year of Jubilee. The price ofhis sale shall be according to the number of years; he shall be with him according to the time of a hired servant.
\v 51 If there are yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that hewas bought for. 
\v 52 If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of servicehe shall give back the price of his redemption. 
\v 53 As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him. He shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight.
\v 54 If he isn’t redeemed by these means, then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee: he and his children with him.
\v 55 For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahwehyour God. 
\c 26 
\v 1 “‘You shall make for yourselves no idols, and you shall not raise up a carved image or a pillar, and you shall not placeany figured stone in your land, to bow down to it; for I am Yahweh your God.
\v 2 “‘You shall keep my Sabbaths, and have reverence for my sanctuary. I am Yahweh.
\v 3 “‘If you walk in my statutes and keep my commandments, and do them,
\v 4 then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shallyield their fruit. 
\v 5 Your threshing shall continue until the vintage, and the vintage shall continue until the sowing time. You shall eat yourbread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. 
\v 6 “‘I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and no one will make you afraid. I will remove evil animals outof the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. 
\v 7 You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
\v 8 Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before youby the sword. 
\v 9 “‘I will have respect for you, make you fruitful, multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.
\v 10 You shall eat old supplies long kept, and you shall move out the old because of the new.
\v 11 I will set my tent among you, and my soul won’t abhor you.
\v 12 I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you will be my people.
\v 13 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves. I have broken thebars of your yoke, and made you walk upright. 
\v 14 “‘But if you will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments,
\v 15 and if you shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhors my ordinances, so that you will not do all my commandments,but break my covenant, 
\v 16 I also will do this to you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, andmake the soul to pine away. You will sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it.
\v 17 I will set my face against you, and you will be struck before your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you; andyou will flee when no one pursues you. 
\v 18 “‘If you in spite of these things will not listen to me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.
\v 19 I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your sky like iron, and your soil like bronze.
\v 20 Your strength will be spent in vain; for your land won’t yield its increase, neither will the trees of the land yieldtheir fruit. 
\v 21 “‘If you walk contrary to me, and won’t listen to me, then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to yoursins. 
\v 22 I will send the wild animals among you, which will rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and make you few innumber. Your roads will become desolate. 
\v 23 “‘If by these things you won’t be turned back to me, but will walk contrary to me,
\v 24 then I will also walk contrary to you; and I will strike you, even I, seven times for your sins.
\v 25 I will bring a sword upon you that will execute the vengeance of the covenant. You will be gathered together within yourcities, and I will send the pestilence among you. You will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
\v 26 When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again byweight. You shall eat, and not be satisfied. 
\v 27 “‘If you in spite of this won’t listen to me, but walk contrary to me,
\v 28 then I will walk contrary to you in wrath. I will also chastise you seven times for your sins.
\v 29 You will eat the flesh of your sons, and you will eat the flesh of your daughters.
\v 30 I will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of youridols; and my soul will abhor you. 
\v 31 I will lay your cities waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation. I will not take delight in the sweetfragrance of your offerings. 
\v 32 I will bring the land into desolation, and your enemies that dwell in it will be astonished at it.
\v 33 I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you. Your land will be a desolation, and yourcities shall be a waste. 
\v 34 Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies’ land. Even then the landwill rest and enjoy its Sabbaths. 
\v 35 As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it didn’t have in your Sabbaths when you lived on it.
\v 36 “‘As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. The sound ofa driven leaf will put them to flight; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword. They will fall when no one pursues.
\v 37 They will stumble over one another, as it were before the sword, when no one pursues. You will have no power to standbefore your enemies. 
\v 38 You will perish among the nations. The land of your enemies will eat you up.
\v 39 Those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of theirfathers they shall pine away with them. 
\v 40 “‘If they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me;and also that because they walked contrary to me, 
\v 41 I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart ishumbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity, 
\v 42 then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham; and I willremember the land. 
\v 43 The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without them; and they will acceptthe punishment of their iniquity because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.
\v 44 Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, todestroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God.
\v 45 But I will for their sake remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sightof the nations, that I might be their God. I am Yahweh.’” 
\v 46 These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws, which Yahweh made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai byMoses. 
\c 27 
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, ‘When a man consecrates a person to Yahweh in a vow, according to yourvaluation, 
\v 3 your valuation of a male from twenty years old to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to theshekel\f + \fr 27:3 \ft A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35ounces.\f* of the sanctuary. 
\v 4 If she is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.
\v 5 If the person is from five years old to twenty years old, then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and fora female ten shekels. 
\v 6 If the person is from a month old to five years old, then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, andfor a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver. 
\v 7 If the person is from sixty years old and upward; if he is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for afemale ten shekels. 
\v 8 But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall assign a value tohim. The priest shall assign a value according to his ability to pay.
\v 9 “‘If it is an animal of which men offer an offering to Yahweh, all that any man gives of such to Yahweh becomes holy.
\v 10 He shall not alter it, nor exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. If he shall at all exchange animal foranimal, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy.
\v 11 If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to Yahweh, then he shall set the animal before thepriest; 
\v 12 and the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest evaluates it, so it shall be.
\v 13 But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation.
\v 14 “‘When a man dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad. Asthe priest evaluates it, so it shall stand. 
\v 15 If he who dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, andit shall be his. 
\v 16 “‘If a man dedicates to Yahweh part of the field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seedfor it. The sowing of a homer \f + \fr 27:16 \ft 1 homer is about 220 liters or 6bushels\f* of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels\f + \fr 27:16 \ft A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces.\f* of silver.
\v 17 If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.
\v 18 But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the yearsthat remain to the Year of Jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from your valuation.
\v 19 If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation toit, and it shall remain his. 
\v 20 If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more;
\v 21 but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to Yahweh, as a devoted field. It shall be owned by thepriests. 
\v 22 “‘If he dedicates a field to Yahweh which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,
\v 23 then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee; and he shall give yourvaluation on that day, as a holy thing to Yahweh. 
\v 24 In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of theland belongs. 
\v 25 All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twentygerahs\f + \fr 27:25 \ft A gerah is about 0.5 grams or about 7.7grains.\f* to the shekel.\f + \fr 27:25 \ft A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35ounces.\f* 
\v 26 “‘However the firstborn among animals, which belongs to Yahweh as a firstborn, no man may dedicate, whether an ox or asheep. It is Yahweh’s. 
\v 27 If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according to your valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part ofit; or if it isn’t redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.
\v 28 “‘Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man devotes to Yahweh of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of thefield of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed. Everything that is permanently devoted is most holy to Yahweh.
\v 29 “‘No one devoted to destruction, who shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed. He shall surely be put to death.
\v 30 “‘All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is Yahweh’s. It is holy toYahweh. 
\v 31 If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it.
\v 32 All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Yahweh.
\v 33 He shall not examine whether it is good or bad, neither shall he exchange it. If he exchanges it at all, then both it andthat for which it is exchanged shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.’”
\v 34 These are the commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.
