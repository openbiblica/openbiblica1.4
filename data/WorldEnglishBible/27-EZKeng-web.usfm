\c 1 
\v 1 Now in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth of the month, as I was among the captives by the riverChebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.\f + \fr 1:1 \ft The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).\f* 
\v 2 In the fifth of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,
\v 3 Yahweh’s\f + \fr 1:3 \ft “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in othertranslations.\f* word came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; andYahweh’s hand was there on him. 
\v 4 I looked, and behold,\f + \fr 1:4 \ft “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. Itis often used as an interjection.\f* a stormy wind came out of the north: a great cloud, with flashing lightning, and abrightness around it, and out of the middle of it as it were glowing metal, out of the middle of the fire.
\v 5 Out of its center came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: They had the likeness of a man.
\v 6 Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.
\v 7 Their feet were straight feet. The sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnishedbronze. 
\v 8 They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. The four of them had their faces and their wings likethis: 
\v 9 Their wings were joined to one another. They didn’t turn when they went. Each one went straight forward.
\v 10 As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man. The four of them had the face of a lion on the rightside. The four of them had the face of an ox on the left side. The four of them also had the face of an eagle.
\v 11 Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Two wings of each one touched another, and two covered theirbodies. 
\v 12 Each one went straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went. They didn’t turn when they went.
\v 13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance oftorches. The fire went up and down among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and lightning went out of the fire.
\v 14 The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
\v 15 Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, there was one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each of thefour faces of it. 
\v 16 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl. The four of them had one likeness. Their appearance andtheir work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. 
\v 17 When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn when they went.
\v 18 As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around.
\v 19 When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. When the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, thewheels were lifted up. 
\v 20 Wherever the spirit was to go, they went. The spirit was to go there. The wheels were lifted up beside them; for thespirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 
\v 21 When those went, these went. When those stood, these stood. When those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels werelifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\v 22 Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like an awesome crystal to look at, stretchedout over their heads above. 
\v 23 Under the expanse, their wings were straight, one toward the other. Each one had two which covered on this side, and eachone had two which covered their bodies on that side. 
\v 24 When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noiseof tumult like the noise of an army. When they stood, they let down their wings.
\v 25 There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings.
\v 26 Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of asapphire\f + \fr 1:26 \ft or, lapis lazuli\f* stone. On the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a manon it above. 
\v 27 I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it all around, from the appearance of his waist andupward; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightnessaround him. 
\v 28 As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness allaround. This was the appearance of the likeness of Yahweh’s glory. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one thatspoke. 
\c 2 
\v 1 He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.”
\v 2 The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.
\v 3 He said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. Theyand their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.
\v 4 The children are impudent and stiff-hearted. I am sending you to them, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what theLord\f + \fr 2:4 \ft The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”\f* Yahweh says.’
\v 5 They, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse, for they are a rebellious house, yet they will know that therehas been a prophet among them. 
\v 6 You, son of man, don’t be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and youdwell among scorpions. Don’t be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
\v 7 You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse; for they are most rebellious.
\v 8 But you, son of man, hear what I tell you. Don’t be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth, and eat thatwhich I give you.” 
\v 9 When I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me; and, behold, a scroll of a book was in it.
\v 10 He spread it before me. It was written within and without; and lamentations, mourning, and woe were written in it.
\c 3 
\v 1 He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”
\v 2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll. 
\v 3 He said to me, “Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you.”\p Then I ate it; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. 
\v 4 He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them.
\v 5 For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;
\v 6 not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can’t understand. Surely, if I sent you tothem, they would listen to you. 
\v 7 But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they will not listen to me; for all the house of Israel areobstinate\f + \fr 3:7 \ft Literally, have a hard forehead\f* and hard-hearted.
\v 8 Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.
\v 9 I have made your forehead as a diamond, harder than flint. Don’t be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks,though they are a rebellious house.” 
\v 10 Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, receive in your heart and hear with your ears all my words that I speak to you.
\v 11 Go to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, ‘This is what the LordYahweh says,’ whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse.
\v 12 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, “Blessed be Yahweh’s glory fromhis place.” 
\v 13 I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels besidethem, even the noise of a great rushing. 
\v 14 So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and Yahweh’s hand wasstrong on me. 
\v 15 Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I satthere overwhelmed among them seven days. 
\v 16 At the end of seven days, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 17 “Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and warn them fromme. 
\v 18 When I tell the wicked, ‘You will surely die;’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wickedway, to save his life; that wicked man will die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand.
\v 19 Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn’t turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he will die in hisiniquity; but you have delivered your soul.” 
\v 20 “Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him,he will die. Because you have not given him warning, he will die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done will notbe remembered; but I will require his blood at your hand. 
\v 21 Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live, becausehe took warning; and you have delivered your soul.” 
\v 22 Yahweh’s hand was there on me; and he said to me, “Arise, go out into the plain, and I will talk with you there.”
\v 23 Then I arose, and went out into the plain, and behold, Yahweh’s glory stood there, like the glory which I saw by theriver Chebar. Then I fell on my face. 
\v 24 Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet. He spoke with me, and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside yourhouse. 
\v 25 But you, son of man, behold, they will put ropes on you, and will bind you with them, and you will not go out among them.
\v 26 I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, that you will be mute, and will not be able to correct them; forthey are a rebellious house. 
\v 27 But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lord Yahweh says.’ He whohears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.”
\c 4 
\v 1 “You also, son of man, take a tile, and lay it before yourself, and portray on it a city, even Jerusalem.
\v 2 Lay siege against it, build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it. Also set camps against it and plantbattering rams against it all around. 
\v 3 Take for yourself an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city. Then set your face toward it. Itwill be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.
\v 4 “Moreover lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it. According to the number of the daysthat you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity. 
\v 5 For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days, even three hundred ninety days. So youshall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 
\v 6 “Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house ofJudah. I have appointed forty days, each day for a year, to you.
\v 7 You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered; and you shall prophesy against it.
\v 8 Behold, I put ropes on you, and you shall not turn yourself from one side to the other, until you have accomplished thedays of your siege. 
\v 9 “Take for yourself also wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel. Make bread of it.According to the number of the days that you will lie on your side, even three hundred ninety days, you shall eat of it.
\v 10 Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels\f + \fr 4:10 \ft A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces.\f* a day. From time to time you shall eat it.
\v 11 You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin.\f + \fr 4:11 \ft A hin is about 6.5 liters or 1.7 gallons.\f* From time to time you shall drink.
\v 12 You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.”
\v 13 Yahweh said, “Even thus will the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.”
\v 14 Then I said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! Behold, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even until now I have not eatenof that which dies of itself, or is torn of animals. No abominable meat has come into my mouth!”
\v 15 Then he said to me, “Behold, I have given you cow’s dung for man’s dung, and you shall prepare your bread on it.”
\v 16 Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They will eat bread by weight,and with fearfulness. They will drink water by measure, and in dismay;
\v 17 that they may lack bread and water, be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.
\c 5 
\v 1 “You, son of man, take a sharp sword. You shall take it as a barber’s razor to yourself, and shall cause it to pass overyour head and over your beard. Then take balances to weigh and divide the hair.
\v 2 A third part you shall burn in the fire in the middle of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled. You shalltake a third part, and strike with the sword around it. A third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a swordafter them. 
\v 3 You shall take of it a few in number, and bind them in the folds of your robe.
\v 4 Of these again you shall take, and cast them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From it a fire willcome out into all the house of Israel. 
\v 5 “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the middle of the nations, and countries are around her.
\v 6 She has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than thecountries that are around her; for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.’
\v 7 “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are around you, and have not walkedin my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances, neither have followed the ordinances of the nations that are around you;
\v 8 therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgments among you in the sight ofthe nations. 
\v 9 I will do in you that which I have not done, and which I will not do anything like it any more, because of all yourabominations. 
\v 10 Therefore the fathers will eat the sons within you, and the sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments on you;and I will scatter the whole remnant of you to all the winds. 
\v 11 Therefore as I live,’ says the Lord Yahweh, ‘surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestablethings, and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish you. My eye won’t spare, and I will have no pity.
\v 12 A third part of you will die with the pestilence, and they will be consumed with famine within you. A third part willfall by the sword around you. A third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.
\v 13 “‘Thus my anger will be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I will be comforted. They willknow that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath on them.
\v 14 “‘Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are around you, in the sight of all thatpass by. 
\v 15 So it will be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, to the nations that are around you, when Iexecute judgments on you in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes—I, Yahweh, have spoken it—
\v 16 when I send on them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. I will increasethe famine on you, and will break your staff of bread. 
\v 17 I will send on you famine and evil animals, and they will bereave you. Pestilence and blood will pass through you. I willbring the sword on you. I, Yahweh, have spoken it.’” 
\c 6 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them,
\v 3 and say, ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh! The Lord Yahweh says to the mountains and to thehills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: “Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your highplaces. 
\v 4 Your altars will become desolate, and your incense altars will be broken. I will cast down your slain men before youridols. 
\v 5 I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols. I will scatter your bones around your altars.
\v 6 In all your dwelling places, the cities will be laid waste and the high places will be desolate; that your altars may belaid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your incense altars may be cut down, and your worksmay be abolished. 
\v 7 The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am Yahweh.
\v 8 “‘“Yet I will leave a remnant, in that you will have some that escape the sword among the nations, when you are scatteredthrough the countries. 
\v 9 Those of you that escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken withtheir lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the prostitute after their idols. Then they willloathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
\v 10 They will know that I am Yahweh. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.”’
\v 11 “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, “Alas!” Because of all the evilabominations of the house of Israel; for they will fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.
\v 12 He who is far off will die of the pestilence. He who is near will fall by the sword. He who remains and is besieged willdie by the famine. Thus I will accomplish my wrath on them. 
\v 13 You will know that I am Yahweh, when their slain men are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, onall the tops of the mountains, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered pleasant aromato all their idols. 
\v 14 I will stretch out my hand on them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughoutall their habitations. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’” 
\c 7 
\v 1 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “You, son of man, the Lord Yahweh says to the land of Israel, ‘An end! The end has come on the four corners of the land.
\v 3 Now is the end on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you allyour abominations. 
\v 4 My eye will not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways on you, and your abominations will beamong you. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.’ 
\v 5 “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘An evil! A unique evil! Behold, it comes.
\v 6 An end has come. The end has come! It awakes against you. Behold, it comes.
\v 7 Your doom has come to you, inhabitant of the land! The time has come! The day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyfulshouting, on the mountains. 
\v 8 Now I will shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against you, and will judge you according to yourways. I will bring on you all your abominations. 
\v 9 My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways. Your abominations will be amongyou. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, strike. 
\v 10 “‘Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has gone out. The rod has blossomed. Pride has budded.
\v 11 Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness. None of them will remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth.There will be nothing of value among them. 
\v 12 The time has come! The day draws near. Don’t let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all itsmultitude. 
\v 13 For the seller won’t return to that which is sold, although they are still alive; for the vision concerns the wholemultitude of it. None will return. None will strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.
\v 14 They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but no one goes to the battle; for my wrath is on all itsmultitude. 
\v 15 “‘The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine within. He who is in the field will die by the sword. He who isin the city will be devoured by famine and pestilence. 
\v 16 But those of those who escape, they will escape and will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of themmoaning, everyone in his iniquity. 
\v 17 All hands will be feeble, and all knees will be weak as water.
\v 18 They will also clothe themselves with sackcloth, and horror will cover them. Shame will be on all faces, and baldness onall their heads. 
\v 19 They will cast their silver in the streets, and their gold will be as an unclean thing. Their silver and their gold won’tbe able to deliver them in the day of Yahweh’s wrath. They won’t satisfy their souls or fill their bellies; because it has beenthe stumbling block of their iniquity. 
\v 20 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations and theirdetestable things therein. Therefore I have made it to them as an unclean thing.
\v 21 I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a plunder; and they willprofane it. 
\v 22 I will also turn my face from them, and they will profane my secret place. Robbers will enter into it, and profane it.
\v 23 “‘Make chains; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
\v 24 Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses. I will also make the pride of thestrong to cease. Their holy places will be profaned. 
\v 25 Destruction comes! They will seek peace, and there will be none.
\v 26 Mischief will come on mischief, and rumor will be on rumor. They will seek a vision of the prophet; but the law willperish from the priest, and counsel from the elders. 
\v 27 The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with desolation. The hands of the people of the land will betroubled. I will do to them after their way, and according to their own judgments I will judge them. Then they will know that Iam Yahweh.’” 
\c 8 
\v 1 In the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah satbefore me, the Lord Yahweh’s hand fell on me there. 
\v 2 Then I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his waist and downward, fire; andfrom his waist and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.
\v 3 He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and thesky, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looks toward the north;where there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.
\v 4 Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.
\v 5 Then he said to me, “Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north.”\p So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and saw, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in theentry. 
\v 6 He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they do? Even the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here,that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you will again see yet other great abominations.”
\v 7 He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.
\v 8 Then he said to me, “Son of man, dig now in the wall.” When I had dug in the wall, I saw a door. 
\v 9 He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.”
\v 10 So I went in and looked, and saw every form of creeping things, abominable animals, and all the idols of the house ofIsrael, portrayed around on the wall. 
\v 11 Seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel stood before them. In the middle of them Jaazaniah the son of Shaphanstood, every man with his censer in his hand; and the smell of the cloud of incense went up.
\v 12 Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in hisrooms of imagery? For they say, ‘Yahweh doesn’t see us. Yahweh has forsaken the land.’”
\v 13 He said also to me, “You will again see more of the great abominations which they do.”
\v 14 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh’s house which was toward the north; and I saw the women sit thereweeping for Tammuz. 
\v 15 Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? You will again see yet greater abominations than these.”
\v 16 He brought me into the inner court of Yahweh’s house; and I saw at the door of Yahweh’s temple, between the porch and thealtar, there were about twenty-five men, with their backs toward Yahweh’s temple, and their faces toward the east. They wereworshiping the sun toward the east. 
\v 17 Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit theabominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger.Behold, they put the branch to their nose. 
\v 18 Therefore I will also deal in wrath. My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. Though they cry in my ears with a loudvoice, yet I will not hear them.” 
\c 9 
\v 1 Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near, each man withhis destroying weapon in his hand.” 
\v 2 Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon inhis hand. One man in the middle of them was clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. They went in, and stoodbeside the bronze altar. 
\v 3 The glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house; and he called tothe man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side.
\v 4 Yahweh said to him, “Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheadsof the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done within it.”
\v 5 To the others he said in my hearing, “Go through the city after him, and strike. Don’t let your eye spare, neither havepity. 
\v 6 Kill utterly the old man, the young man, the virgin, little children and women; but don’t come near any man on whom is themark. Begin at my sanctuary.” Then they began at the old men who were before the house. 
\v 7 He said to them, “Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!”\p They went out, and struck in the city. 
\v 8 While they were killing, and I was left, I fell on my face, and cried, and said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! Will you destroy all theresidue of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem?”
\v 9 Then he said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood,and the city full of perversion; for they say, ‘Yahweh has forsaken the land, and Yahweh doesn’t see.’
\v 10 As for me also, my eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way on their head.”
\v 11 Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, “I have done as you havecommanded me.” 
\c 10 
\v 1 Then I looked, and see, in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were asapphire\f + \fr 10:1 \ft or, lapis lazuli \f* stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
\v 2 He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, “Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill bothyour hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.”\p He went in as I watched. 
\v 3 Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
\v 4 Yahweh’s glory mounted up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with thecloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh’s glory.
\v 5 The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
\v 6 It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, frombetween the cherubim,” that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.
\v 7 The cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some ofit, and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
\v 8 The form of a man’s hand appeared here in the cherubim under their wings.
\v 9 I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel besideanother cherub. The appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.
\v 10 As for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, like a wheel within a wheel.
\v 11 When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn as they went, but to the place where the head lookedthey followed it. They didn’t turn as they went. 
\v 12 Their whole body, including their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes all around, even thewheels that the four of them had. 
\v 13 As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “the whirling wheels”.
\v 14 Every one them had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub. The second face was the face of a man. Thethird face was the face of a lion. The fourth was the face of an eagle.
\v 15 The cherubim mounted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.
\v 16 When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from theearth, the wheels also didn’t turn from beside them. 
\v 17 When they stood, these stood. When they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creature wasin them. 
\v 18 Yahweh’s glory went out from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
\v 19 The cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out, with the wheels besidethem. Then they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
\v 20 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.
\v 21 Every one had four faces, and every one four wings. The likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
\v 22 As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances andthemselves. They each went straight forward. 
\c 11 
\v 1 Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of Yahweh’s house, which looks eastward. Behold,twenty-five men were at the door of the gate; and I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah,princes of the people. 
\v 2 He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city;
\v 3 who say, ‘The time is not near to build houses. This is the cauldron, and we are the meat.’
\v 4 Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.” 
\v 5 Yahweh’s Spirit fell on me, and he said to me, “Speak, ‘Yahweh says: “Thus you have said, house of Israel; for I know thethings that come into your mind. 
\v 6 You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.
\v 7 “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Your slain whom you have laid in the middle of it, they are the meat, and this is thecauldron; but you will be brought out of the middle of it. 
\v 8 You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword on you,” says the Lord Yahweh.
\v 9 “I will bring you out of the middle of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments amongyou. 
\v 10 You will fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.
\v 11 This will not be your cauldron, neither will you be the meat in the middle of it. I will judge you in the border ofIsrael. 
\v 12 You will know that I am Yahweh, for you have not walked in my statutes, You have not executed my ordinances, but havedone after the ordinances of the nations that are around you.”’”
\v 13 When I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?”
\v 14 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 15 “Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your relatives, and all the house of Israel, all of them, arethey to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Go far away from Yahweh. This land has been given to us for apossession.’” 
\v 16 “Therefore say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I havescattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they havecome.”’ 
\v 17 “Therefore say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries whereyou have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.”
\v 18 “‘They will come there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there.
\v 19 I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, andwill give them a heart of flesh; 
\v 20 that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them. They will be my people, and I will be their God.
\v 21 But as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring theirway on their own heads,’ says the Lord Yahweh.” 
\v 22 Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them. The glory of the God of Israel was over themabove. 
\v 23 Yahweh’s glory went up from the middle of the city, and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city.
\v 24 The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the captives.\p So the vision that I had seen went up from me. 
\v 25 Then I spoke to the captives all the things that Yahweh had shown me.
\c 12 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word also came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, you dwell in the middle of the rebellious house, who have eyes to see, and don’t see, who have ears to hear,and don’t hear; for they are a rebellious house. 
\v 3 “Therefore, you son of man, prepare your stuff for moving, and move by day in their sight. You shall move from your placeto another place in their sight. It may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.
\v 4 You shall bring out your stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for moving. You shall go out yourself at evening in theirsight, as when men go out into exile. 
\v 5 Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your stuff out that way.
\v 6 In their sight you shall bear it on your shoulder, and carry it out in the dark. You shall cover your face, so that youdon’t see the land, for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel.”
\v 7 I did so as I was commanded. I brought out my stuff by day, as stuff for moving, and in the evening I dug through the wallwith my hand. I brought it out in the dark, and bore it on my shoulder in their sight.
\v 8 In the morning, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 9 “Son of man, hasn’t the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’
\v 10 “Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel amongwhom they are.”’ 
\v 11 “Say, ‘I am your sign. As I have done, so will it be done to them. They will go into exile, into captivity.
\v 12 “‘The prince who is among them will bear on his shoulder in the dark, and will go out. They will dig through the wall tocarry things out that way. He will cover his face, because he will not see the land with his eyes.
\v 13 I will also spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon to the land of theChaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there. 
\v 14 I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him to help him, and all his bands. I will draw out the sword afterthem. 
\v 15 “‘They will know that I am Yahweh when I disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.
\v 16 But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence, that they may declare alltheir abominations among the nations where they come. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’”
\v 17 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 18 “Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and with fearfulness.
\v 19 Tell the people of the land, ‘The Lord Yahweh says concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: “Theywill eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, and all that is therein,because of the violence of all those who dwell therein. 
\v 20 The cities that are inhabited will be laid waste, and the land will be a desolation. Then you will know that I amYahweh.”’” 
\v 21 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 22 “Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, ‘The days are prolonged, and every visionfails?’ 
\v 23 Tell them therefore, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “I will make this proverb to cease, and they will no more use it as a proverbin Israel;”’ but tell them, ‘“The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.
\v 24 For there will be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
\v 25 For I am Yahweh. I will speak, and the word that I speak will be performed. It will be no more deferred; for in yourdays, rebellious house, I will speak the word, and will perform it,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”
\v 26 Again Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 27 “Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, ‘The vision that he sees is for many days to come, and heprophesies of times that are far off.’ 
\v 28 “Therefore tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “None of my words will be deferred any more, but the word which I speak willbe performed,” says the Lord Yahweh.’” 
\c 13 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word: 
\v 3 The Lord Yahweh says, “Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
\v 4 Israel, your prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.
\v 5 You have not gone up into the gaps or built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in Yahweh’s day.
\v 6 They have seen falsehood and lying divination, who say, ‘Yahweh says;’ but Yahweh has not sent them. They have made men tohope that the word would be confirmed. 
\v 7 Haven’t you seen a false vision, and haven’t you spoken a lying divination, in that you say, ‘Yahweh says;’ but I have notspoken?” 
\v 8 “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Because you have spoken falsehood and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you,”says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 9 “My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who utter lying divinations. They will not be in thecouncil of my people, neither will they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither will they enter into the landof Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.” 
\v 10 “‘Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, “Peace;” and there is no peace. When one builds up a wall,behold, they plaster it with whitewash. 
\v 11 Tell those who plaster it with whitewash that it will fall. There will be an overflowing shower; and you, greathailstones, will fall. A stormy wind will tear it. 
\v 12 Behold, when the wall has fallen, won’t it be said to you, “Where is the plaster with which you have plastered it?”
\v 13 “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “I will even tear it with a stormy wind in my wrath. There will be an overflowingshower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.
\v 14 So I will break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that itsfoundation will be uncovered. It will fall, and you will be consumed in the middle of it. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.
\v 15 Thus I will accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on those who have plastered it with whitewash. I will tell you, ‘Thewall is no more, neither those who plastered it; 
\v 16 to wit, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and there is nopeace,’” says the Lord Yahweh.’” 
\v 17 You, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesyagainst them, 
\v 18 and say, “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Woe to the women who sew pillows on all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head ofpersons of every stature to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?
\v 19 You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls who should notdie, and to save the souls alive who should not live, by your lying to my people who listen to lies.’
\v 20 “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I am against your pillows, with which you hunt the souls to make them fly, andI will tear them from your arms. I will let the souls go, even the souls whom you hunt to make them fly.
\v 21 I will also tear your kerchiefs, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they will be no more in your hand to behunted. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. 
\v 22 Because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands ofthe wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive.
\v 23 Therefore you shall no more see false visions, nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. Thenyou will know that I am Yahweh.’” 
\c 14 
\v 1 Then some of the elders of Israel came to me, and sat before me.
\v 2 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 3 “Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before theirface. Should I be inquired of at all by them? 
\v 4 Therefore speak to them, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols intohis heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I Yahweh will answer himtherein according to the multitude of his idols; 
\v 5 that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.”’
\v 6 “Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Return, and turn yourselves from your idols! Turn away yourfaces from all your abominations. 
\v 7 “‘“For everyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who live in Israel, who separates himself from me, and takeshis idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to inquire forhimself of me; I Yahweh will answer him by myself. 
\v 8 I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him offfrom among my people. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. 
\v 9 “‘“If the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, Yahweh, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand onhim, and will destroy him from among my people Israel. 
\v 10 They will bear their iniquity. The iniquity of the prophet will be even as the iniquity of him who seeks him;
\v 11 that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions;but that they may be my people, and I may be their God,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”
\v 12 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 13 “Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand on it, and break the staffof its bread, and send famine on it, and cut off from it man and animal;
\v 14 though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only their own souls by theirrighteousness,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 15 “If I cause evil animals to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it is made desolate, so that no man may passthrough because of the animals; 
\v 16 though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters. Theyonly would be delivered, but the land would be desolate. 
\v 17 “Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, ‘Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and animal;’
\v 18 though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, butthey only would be delivered themselves. 
\v 19 “Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath on it in blood, to cut off from it man and animal;
\v 20 though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “they would deliver neither son nor daughter;they would deliver only their own souls by their righteousness.”
\v 21 For the Lord Yahweh says: “How much more when I send my four severe judgments on Jerusalem, the sword, the famine, theevil animals, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and animal!
\v 22 Yet, behold, there will be left a remnant in it that will be carried out, both sons and daughters. Behold, they will comeout to you, and you will see their way and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought onJerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it. 
\v 23 They will comfort you, when you see their way and their doings; then you will know that I have not done all that I havedone in it without cause,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\c 15 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?
\v 3 Will wood be taken of it to make anything? Will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel on it?
\v 4 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both its ends, and the middle of it is burned. Is itprofitable for any work? 
\v 5 Behold, when it was whole, it was suitable for no work. How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it has beenburned, will it yet be suitable for any work?” 
\v 6 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel,so I will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
\v 7 I will set my face against them. They will go out from the fire, but the fire will devour them. Then you will know that Iam Yahweh, when I set my face against them. 
\v 8 I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass,” says the Lord Yahweh.
\c 16 
\v 1 Again Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations; 
\v 3 and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says to Jerusalem: “Your origin and your birth is of the land of the Canaanite. An Amorite wasyour father, and your mother was a Hittite. 
\v 4 As for your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut. You weren’t washed in water to cleanse you. Youweren’t salted at all, nor wrapped in blankets at all. 
\v 5 No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you, to have compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field,because you were abhorred in the day that you were born. 
\v 6 “‘“When I passed by you, and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’ Yes, Isaid to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’ 
\v 7 I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field, and you increased and grew great, and you attained to excellentornament. Your breasts were formed, and your hair grew; yet you were naked and bare.
\v 8 “‘“Now when I passed by you, and looked at you, behold, your time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over you,and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore to you, and entered into a covenant with you,” says the Lord Yahweh, “and you becamemine. 
\v 9 “‘“Then washed I you with water. Yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.
\v 10 I clothed you also with embroidered work, and put sealskin sandals on you. I dressed you with fine linen and covered youwith silk. 
\v 11 I decked you with ornaments, put bracelets on your hands, and put a chain on your neck.
\v 12 I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.
\v 13 Thus you were decked with gold and silver. Your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered work. You ate fineflour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and you prospered to royal estate.
\v 14 Your renown went out among the nations for your beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put on you,”says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 15 “‘“But you trusted in your beauty, and played the prostitute because of your renown, and poured out your prostitution oneveryone who passed by. It was his. 
\v 16 You took some of your garments, and made for yourselves high places decked with various colors, and played the prostituteon them. This shall not happen, neither shall it be. 
\v 17 You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images ofmen, and played the prostitute with them. 
\v 18 You took your embroidered garments, covered them, and set my oil and my incense before them.
\v 19 My bread also which I gave you, fine flour, oil, and honey, with which I fed you, you even set it before them for apleasant aroma; and so it was,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 20 “‘“Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and you have sacrificed these to themto be devoured. Was your prostitution a small matter, 
\v 21 that you have slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through the fire to them?
\v 22 In all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked andbare, and were wallowing in your blood. 
\v 23 “‘“It has happened after all your wickedness. Woe, woe to you!” says the Lord Yahweh,
\v 24 “that you have built for yourselves a vaulted place, and have made yourselves a lofty place in every street.
\v 25 You have built your lofty place at the head of every way, and have made your beauty an abomination, and have opened yourfeet to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your prostitution.
\v 26 You have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians, your neighbors, great of flesh; and have multiplied yourprostitution, to provoke me to anger. 
\v 27 See therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your portion, and delivered you to the will ofthose who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way.
\v 28 You have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yes, you have played the prostitutewith them, and yet you weren’t satisfied. 
\v 29 You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants, to Chaldea; and yet you weren’t satisfied withthis. 
\v 30 “‘“How weak is your heart,” says the Lord Yahweh, “since you do all these things, the work of an impudent prostitute;
\v 31 in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way, and make your lofty place in every street, and have notbeen as a prostitute, in that you scorn pay. 
\v 32 “‘“A wife who commits adultery! Who takes strangers instead of her husband!
\v 33 People give gifts to all prostitutes; but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them, that they may come toyou on every side for your prostitution. 
\v 34 You are different from other women in your prostitution, in that no one follows you to play the prostitute; and whereasyou give hire, and no hire is given to you, therefore you are different.”’
\v 35 “Therefore, prostitute, hear Yahweh’s word: 
\v 36 ‘The Lord Yahweh says, “Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitutionwith your lovers; and because of all the idols of your abominations, and for the blood of your children, that you gave to them;
\v 37 therefore see, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all those who you have loved, withall those who you have hated. I will even gather them against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, thatthey may see all your nakedness. 
\v 38 I will judge you, as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath andjealousy. 
\v 39 I will also give you into their hand, and they will throw down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places. Theywill strip you of your clothes, and take your beautiful jewels. They will leave you naked and bare.
\v 40 They will also bring up a company against you, and they will stone you with stones, and thrust you through with theirswords. 
\v 41 They will burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. I will cause you to ceasefrom playing the prostitute, and you will also give no hire any more.
\v 42 So I will cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy will depart from you. I will be quiet, and will not be angryany more. 
\v 43 “‘“Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have raged against me in all these things; therefore,behold, I also will bring your way on your head,” says the Lord Yahweh: “and you shall not commit this lewdness with all yourabominations. 
\v 44 “‘“Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb against you, saying, ‘As is the mother, so is her daughter.’
\v 45 You are the daughter of your mother, who loathes her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters,who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
\v 46 Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at your left hand, she and her daughters; and your younger sister, who dwells atyour right hand, is Sodom with her daughters. 
\v 47 Yet you have not walked in their ways, nor done their abominations; but soon you were more corrupt than they in all yourways. 
\v 48 As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and yourdaughters. 
\v 49 “‘“Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and inher daughters. She also didn’t strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
\v 50 They were arrogant, and committed abomination before me. Therefore I took them away when I saw it.
\v 51 Samaria hasn’t committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justifiedyour sisters by all your abominations which you have done. 
\v 52 You also bear your own shame yourself, in that you have given judgment for your sisters; through your sins that you havecommitted more abominable than they, they are more righteous than you. Yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in thatyou have justified your sisters. 
\v 53 “‘“I will reverse their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and herdaughters, and the captivity of your captives among them; 
\v 54 that you may bear your own shame, and may be ashamed because of all that you have done, in that you are a comfort tothem. 
\v 55 Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters will return totheir former estate; and you and your daughters will return to your former estate.
\v 56 For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,
\v 57 before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are aroundher, the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you all around.
\v 58 You have borne your lewdness and your abominations,” says Yahweh.
\v 59 “‘For the Lord Yahweh says: “I will also deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking thecovenant. 
\v 60 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlastingcovenant. 
\v 61 Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your sisters, your elder sisters and your younger; andI will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant.
\v 62 I will establish my covenant with you. Then you will know that I am Yahweh;
\v 63 that you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth any more, because of your shame, when I have forgivenyou all that you have done,” says the Lord Yahweh.’” 
\c 17 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, tell a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;
\v 3 and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “A great eagle with great wings and long feathers, full of feathers, which had variouscolors, came to Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar. 
\v 4 He cropped off the topmost of its young twigs, and carried it to a land of traffic. He planted it in a city of merchants.
\v 5 “‘“He also took some of the seed of the land, and planted it in fruitful soil. He placed it beside many waters. He set itas a willow tree. 
\v 6 It grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him. So itbecame a vine, produced branches, and shot out sprigs. 
\v 7 “‘“There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers. Behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, andshot out its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.
\v 8 It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might produce branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it mightbe a good vine.”’ 
\v 9 “Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Will it prosper? Won’t he pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it may wither; thatall its fresh springing leaves may wither? It can’t be raised from its roots by a strong arm or many people.
\v 10 Yes, behold, being planted, will it prosper? Won’t it utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It will wither in thebeds where it grew.”’” 
\v 11 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 12 “Say now to the rebellious house, ‘Don’t you know what these things mean?’ Tell them, ‘Behold, the king of Babylon cameto Jerusalem, and took its king, and its princes, and brought them to him to Babylon.
\v 13 He took some of the royal offspring,\f + \fr 17:13 \ft or,seed\f* and made a covenant with him. He also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land;
\v 14 that the kingdom might be brought low, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.
\v 15 But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Willhe prosper? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the covenant, and still escape?
\v 16 “‘As I live,’ says the Lord Yahweh, ‘surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised,and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the middle of Babylon he will die.
\v 17 Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company won’t help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, tocut off many persons. 
\v 18 For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet has done all thesethings. He won’t escape. 
\v 19 “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘As I live, I will surely bring on his own head my oath that he has despised and mycovenant that he has broken. 
\v 20 I will spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgmentwith him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.
\v 21 All his fugitives in all his bands will fall by the sword, and those who remain will be scattered toward every wind. Thenyou will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it.’ 
\v 22 “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘I will also take some of the lofty top of the cedar, and will plant it. I will crop off from thetopmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
\v 23 I will plant it in the mountain of the height of Israel; and it will produce boughs, and bear fruit, and be a good cedar.Birds of every kind will dwell in the shade of its branches. 
\v 24 All the trees of the field will know that I, Yahweh, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, havedried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree flourish. “‘I, Yahweh, have spoken and have done it.’” 
\c 18 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me again, saying, 
\v 2 “What do you mean, that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge’? 
\v 3 “As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “you shall not use this proverb any more in Israel.
\v 4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. The soul who sins, he shalldie. 
\v 5 “But if a man is just, and does that which is lawful and right, 
\v 6 and has not eaten on the mountains, hasn’t lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hasn’t defiled his neighbor’s wife, hasn’t come near a woman in her impurity, 
\v 7 and has not wronged any, but has restored to the debtor his pledge, has taken nothing by robbery, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment; 
\v 8 he who hasn’t lent to them with interest, hasn’t taken any increase from them, who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed true justice between man and man, 
\v 9 has walked in my statutes, and has kept my ordinances, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 10 “If he fathers a son who is a robber who sheds blood, and who does any one of these things,
\v 11 or who does not do any of those things, but even has eaten at the mountain shrines, and defiled his neighbor’s wife, 
\v 12 has wronged the poor and needy, has taken by robbery, has not restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, has committed abomination, 
\v 13 has lent with interest, and has taken increase from the poor; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations. He shall surely die. His blood will be on him.
\v 14 “Now, behold, if he fathers a son, who sees all his father’s sins, which he has done, and fears, and does not such like;
\v 15 who hasn’t eaten on the mountains, hasn’t lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hasn’t defiled his neighbor’s wife, 
\v 16 hasn’t wronged any, hasn’t taken anything to pledge, hasn’t taken by robbery, but has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment; 
\v 17 who has withdrawn his hand from the poor, who hasn’t received interest or increase, has executed my ordinances, has walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father. He shall surely live.
\v 18 As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people,behold, he will die in his iniquity. 
\v 19 “Yet you say, ‘Why doesn’t the son bear the iniquity of the father?’ When the son has done that which is lawful andright, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he will surely live.
\v 20 The soul who sins, he shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear theiniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him.
\v 21 “But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all my statutes, and does that which islawful and right, he shall surely live. He shall not die. 
\v 22 None of his transgressions that he has committed will be remembered against him. In his righteousness that he has done,he shall live. 
\v 23 Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked?” says the Lord Yahweh; “and not rather that he should return from hisway, and live? 
\v 24 “But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all theabominations that the wicked man does, should he live? None of his righteous deeds that he has done will be remembered. In histrespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them he shall die.
\v 25 “Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not equal.’ Hear now, house of Israel: Is my way not equal? Aren’t your waysunequal? 
\v 26 When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies therein; in his iniquity that hehas done he shall die. 
\v 27 Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right,he will save his soul alive. 
\v 28 Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live. He shallnot die. 
\v 29 Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ House of Israel, aren’t my ways fair? Aren’t your waysunfair? 
\v 30 “Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, everyone according to his ways,” says the Lord Yahweh. “Return, and turnyourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity will not be your ruin.
\v 31 Cast away from you all your transgressions, in which you have transgressed; and make yourself a new heart and a newspirit: for why will you die, house of Israel? 
\v 32 For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies,” says the Lord Yahweh. “Therefore turn yourselves, and live!
\c 19 
\v 1 “Moreover, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
\v 2 and say, ‘What was your mother? A lioness. She couched among lions, in the middle of the young lions she nourished her cubs. 
\v 3 She brought up one of her cubs. He became a young lion. He learned to catch the prey. He devoured men. 
\v 4 The nations also heard of him. He was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt. 
\v 5 “‘Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her cubs, and made him a young lion. 
\v 6 He went up and down among the lions. He became a young lion. He learned to catch the prey. He devoured men. 
\v 7 He knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities. The land was desolate, with its fullness, because of the noise of his roaring. 
\v 8 Then the nations attacked him on every side from the provinces. They spread their net over him. He was taken in their pit. 
\v 9 They put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon. They brought him into strongholds, so that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel. 
\v 10 “‘Your mother was like a vine in your blood, planted by the waters. It was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.
\v 11 It had strong branches for the scepters of those who ruled. Their stature was exalted among the thick boughs. They were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches. 
\v 12 But it was plucked up in fury. It was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branches were broken off and withered. The fire consumed them. 
\v 13 Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land. 
\v 14 Fire has gone out of its branches. It has devoured its fruit, so that there is in it no strong branch to be a scepter to rule.’ This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.” 
\c 20 
\v 1 In the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire ofYahweh, and sat before me. 
\v 2 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 3 “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Is it to inquire of me that you havecome? As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “I will not be inquired of by you.”’
\v 4 “Will you judge them, son of man? Will you judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers.
\v 5 Tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “In the day when I chose Israel, and swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob, andmade myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, ‘I am Yahweh your God;’
\v 6 in that day I swore to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowingwith milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands. 
\v 7 I said to them, ‘Each of you throw away the abominations of his eyes. Don’t defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. Iam Yahweh your God.’ 
\v 8 “‘“But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me. They didn’t all throw away the abominations of their eyes.They also didn’t forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against themin the middle of the land of Egypt. 
\v 9 But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, inwhose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
\v 10 So I caused them to go out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
\v 11 I gave them my statutes, and showed them my ordinances, which if a man does, he will live in them.
\v 12 Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Yahweh whosanctifies them. 
\v 13 “‘“But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They didn’t walk in my statutes, and they rejected myordinances, which if a man keeps, he shall live in them. They greatly profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out mywrath on them in the wilderness, to consume them. 
\v 14 But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I broughtthem out. 
\v 15 Moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them,flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands; 
\v 16 because they rejected my ordinances, and didn’t walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; for their heart went aftertheir idols. 
\v 17 Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I didn’t destroy them. I didn’t make a full end of them in the wilderness.
\v 18 I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Don’t walk in the statutes of your fathers. Don’t observe their ordinancesor defile yourselves with their idols. 
\v 19 I am Yahweh your God. Walk in my statutes, keep my ordinances, and do them.
\v 20 Make my Sabbaths holy. They shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.’
\v 21 “‘“But the children rebelled against me. They didn’t walk in my statutes, and didn’t keep my ordinances to do them, whichif a man does, he shall live in them. They profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplishmy anger against them in the wilderness. 
\v 22 Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of thenations, in whose sight I brought them out. 
\v 23 Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through thecountries; 
\v 24 because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyeswere after their fathers’ idols. 
\v 25 Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they should not live.
\v 26 I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused all that opens the womb to pass through the fire, that I mightmake them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Yahweh.”’
\v 27 “Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Moreover, in this yourfathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
\v 28 For when I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every thicktree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering. There they also madetheir pleasant aroma, and there they poured out their drink offerings.
\v 29 Then I said to them, ‘What does the high place where you go mean?’ So its name is calledBamah\f + \fr 20:29 \ft “Bamah” means “High Place”.\f* to this day.”’
\v 30 “Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Do you pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers? Do youplay the prostitute after their abominations? 
\v 31 When you offer your gifts, when you make your sons pass through the fire, do you pollute yourselves with all your idolsto this day? Should I be inquired of by you, house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will not be inquired of byyou! 
\v 32 “‘“That which comes into your mind will not be at all, in that you say, ‘We will be as the nations, as the families ofthe countries, to serve wood and stone.’ 
\v 33 As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, I willbe king over you. 
\v 34 I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries in which you are scattered with a mightyhand, with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out. 
\v 35 I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.
\v 36 Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgmentwith you,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 37 “I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
\v 38 I will purge out from among you the rebels and those who disobey me. I will bring them out of the land where they live,but they shall not enter into the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”
\v 39 “‘As for you, house of Israel, the Lord Yahweh says: “Go, everyone serve his idols, and hereafter also, if you will notlisten to me; but you shall no more profane my holy name with your gifts and with your idols.
\v 40 For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel,” says the Lord Yahweh, “there all the house of Israel,all of them, shall serve me in the land. There I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings and the first fruitsof your offerings, with all your holy things. 
\v 41 I will accept you as a pleasant aroma when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries in whichyou have been scattered. I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.
\v 42 You will know that I am Yahweh when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I swore to give to yourfathers. 
\v 43 There you will remember your ways, and all your deeds in which you have polluted yourselves. Then you will loatheyourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed.
\v 44 You will know that I am Yahweh, when I have dealt with you for my name’s sake, not according to your evil ways, noraccording to your corrupt doings, you house of Israel,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”
\v 45 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 46 “Son of man, set your face toward the south, and preach toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field inthe South. 
\v 47 Tell the forest of the South, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word: The Lord Yahweh says, “Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and itwill devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree. The burning flame will not be quenched, and all faces from the southto the north will be burned by it. 
\v 48 All flesh will see that I, Yahweh, have kindled it. It will not be quenched.”’”
\v 49 Then I said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! They say of me, ‘Isn’t he a speaker of parables?’”
\c 21 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and preach toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel.
\v 3 Tell the land of Israel, ‘Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against you, and will draw my sword out of its sheath, and will cutoff from you the righteous and the wicked. 
\v 4 Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore my sword will go out of its sheathagainst all flesh from the south to the north. 
\v 5 All flesh will know that I, Yahweh, have drawn my sword out of its sheath. It will not return any more.”’
\v 6 “Therefore sigh, you son of man. You shall sigh before their eyes with a brokenheart\f + \fr 21:6 \ft literally, the breaking of your thighs\f* and with bitterness.
\v 7 It shall be, when they ask you, ‘Why do you sigh?’ that you shall say, ‘Because of the news, for it comes! Every heartwill melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it comes, and itshall be done, says the Lord Yahweh.’” 
\v 8 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 9 “Son of man, prophesy, and say, ‘Yahweh says: “A sword! A sword! It is sharpened, and also polished. 
\v 10 It is sharpened that it may make a slaughter. It is polished that it may be as lightning. Should we then make mirth? The rod of my son condemns every tree. 
\v 11 It is given to be polished, that it may be handled. The sword is sharpened. Yes, it is polished to give it into the hand of the killer.”’ 
\v 12 Cry and wail, son of man; for it is on my people. It is on all the princes of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. Therefore beat your thigh. 
\v 13 “For there is a trial. What if even the rod that condemns will be no more?” says the Lord Yahweh.
\v 14 “You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike your hands together. Let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the fatally wounded. It is the sword of the great one who is fatally wounded, which enters into their rooms. 
\v 15 I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied. Ah! It is made as lightning. It is pointed for slaughter. 
\v 16 Gather yourselves together. Go to the right. Set yourselves in array. Go to the left, wherever your face is set. 
\v 17 I will also strike my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest. I, Yahweh, have spoken it.” 
\v 18 Yahweh’s word came to me again, saying, 
\v 19 “Also, you son of man, appoint two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come. They both will come out of oneland, and mark out a place. Mark it out at the head of the way to the city.
\v 20 You shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem thefortified. 
\v 21 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shook thearrows back and forth. He consulted the teraphim.\f + \fr 21:21 \ft teraphim were household idols that may have been associated with inheritance rights to the householdproperty.\f* He looked in the liver. 
\v 22 In his right hand was the lot for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up thevoice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, and to build forts.
\v 23 It will be to them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity to memory,that they may be taken. 
\v 24 “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Because you have caused your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions areuncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because you have come to memory, you will be taken with the hand.
\v 25 “‘You, deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,
\v 26 the Lord Yahweh says: “Remove the turban, and take off the crown. This will not be as it was. Exalt that which is low,and humble that which is high. 
\v 27 I will overturn, overturn, overturn it. This also will be no more, until he comes whose right it is; and I will giveit.”’ 
\v 28 “You, son of man, prophesy, and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning theirreproach: “A sword! A sword is drawn! It is polished for the slaughter, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning; 
\v 29 while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies to you, to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded, whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end. 
\v 30 Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your birth, I will judge you. 
\v 31 I will pour out my indignation on you. I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath. I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men, skillful to destroy. 
\v 32 You will be for fuel to the fire. Your blood will be in the middle of the land. You will be remembered no more; for I, Yahweh, have spoken it.”’” 
\c 22 
\v 1 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “You, son of man, will you judge? Will you judge the bloody city? Then cause her to know all her abominations.
\v 3 You shall say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “A city that sheds blood within herself, that her time may come, and that makesidols against herself to defile her! 
\v 4 You have become guilty in your blood that you have shed, and are defiled in your idols which you have made! You havecaused your days to draw near, and have come even to your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and amocking to all the countries. 
\v 5 Those who are near, and those who are far from you, will mock you, you infamous one, full of tumult.
\v 6 “‘“Behold, the princes of Israel, everyone according to his power, have been in you to shed blood.
\v 7 In you have they treated father and mother with contempt.\f + \fr 22:7 \ft Literally, \fqa made light of father and mother.\f* Among you they have oppressed the foreigner. In you they have wrongedthe fatherless and the widow. 
\v 8 You have despised my holy things, and have profaned my Sabbaths.
\v 9 Slanderous men have been in you to shed blood. In you they have eaten on the mountains. They have committed lewdness amongyou. 
\v 10 In you have they uncovered their fathers’ nakedness. In you have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity.
\v 11 One has committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law. Another inyou has humbled his sister, his father’s daughter. 
\v 12 In you have they taken bribes to shed blood. You have taken interest and increase, and you have greedily gained of yourneighbors by oppression, and have forgotten me,” says the Lord Yahweh.
\v 13 “‘“Behold, therefore I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at your blood which has beenwithin you. 
\v 14 Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I will deal with you? I, Yahweh, have spoken it, andwill do it. 
\v 15 I will scatter you among the nations, and disperse you through the countries. I will consume your filthiness out of you.
\v 16 You will be profaned in yourself, in the sight of the nations. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”’”
\v 17 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 18 “Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me. All of them are bronze, tin, iron, and lead in the middle of thefurnace. They are the dross of silver. 
\v 19 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Because you have all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the middleof Jerusalem. 
\v 20 As they gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the middle of the furnace, to blow the fire on it, to melt it; soI will gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there, and melt you.
\v 21 Yes, I will gather you, and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you will be melted in the middle of it.
\v 22 As silver is melted in the middle of the furnace, so you will be melted in the middle of it; and you will know that I,Yahweh, have poured out my wrath on you.’” 
\v 23 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 24 “Son of man, tell her, ‘You are a land that is not cleansed, nor rained on in the day of indignation.’
\v 25 There is a conspiracy of her prophets within it, like a roaring lion ravening the prey. They have devoured souls. Theytake treasure and precious things. They have made many widows within it.
\v 26 Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between theholy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hidden their eyes frommy Sabbaths. So I am profaned among them. 
\v 27 Her princes within it are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, that they may get dishonestgain. 
\v 28 Her prophets have plastered for them with whitewash, seeing false visions, and divining lies to them, saying, ‘The LordYahweh says,’ when Yahweh has not spoken. 
\v 29 The people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery. Yes, they have troubled the poor and needy, and haveoppressed the foreigner wrongfully. 
\v 30 “I sought for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I would notdestroy it; but I found no one. 
\v 31 Therefore I have poured out my indignation on them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have brought theirown way on their heads,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\c 23 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.
\v 3 They played the prostitute in Egypt. They played the prostitute in their youth. Their breasts were fondled there, andtheir youthful nipples were caressed there. 
\v 4 Their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As fortheir names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah. 
\v 5 “Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine. She doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,
\v 6 who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.
\v 7 She gave herself as a prostitute to them, all of them the choicest men of Assyria. She defiled herself with the idols ofwhoever she lusted after. 
\v 8 She hasn’t left her prostitution since leaving Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her. They caressed her youthfulnipples; and they poured out their prostitution on her. 
\v 9 “Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she doted.
\v 10 These uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters; and they killed her with the sword. She became abyword among women; for they executed judgments on her. 
\v 11 “Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lusting than she, and in her prostitution which was moredepraved than the prostitution of her sister. 
\v 12 She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and rulers, her neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses,all of them desirable young men. 
\v 13 I saw that she was defiled. They both went the same way. 
\v 14 “She increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with red,
\v 15 dressed with belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like princes, after thelikeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth.
\v 16 As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.
\v 17 The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution. She was polluted withthem, and her soul was alienated from them. 
\v 18 So she uncovered her prostitution and uncovered her nakedness. Then my soul was alienated from her, just like my soul wasalienated from her sister. 
\v 19 Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth, in which she had played the prostitute in theland of Egypt. 
\v 20 She lusted after their lovers, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
\v 21 Thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth, in the caressing of your nipples by the Egyptians because of youryouthful breasts. 
\v 22 “Therefore, Oholibah, the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your soul isalienated, and I will bring them against you on every side: 
\v 23 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; all of them desirable youngmen, governors and rulers, princes and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.
\v 24 They will come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They will set themselvesagainst you with buckler, shield, and helmet all around. I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you accordingto their judgments. 
\v 25 I will set my jealousy against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will take away your nose and your ears.Your remnant will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and the rest of you will be devoured by thefire. 
\v 26 They will also strip you of your clothes, and take away your beautiful jewels.
\v 27 Thus I will make your lewdness to cease from you, and remove your prostitution from the land of Egypt; so that you willnot lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.’ 
\v 28 “For the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them fromwhom your soul is alienated. 
\v 29 They will deal with you in hatred, and will take away all your labor, and will leave you naked and bare. The nakedness ofyour prostitution will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your prostitution.
\v 30 These things will be done to you, because you have played the prostitute after the nations, and because you are pollutedwith their idols. 
\v 31 You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.’
\v 32 “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘You will drink of your sister’s cup, which is deep and large. You will be ridiculed and held in derision. It contains much. 
\v 33 You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria. 
\v 34 You will even drink it and drain it out. You will gnaw the broken pieces of it, and will tear your breasts; for I have spoken it,’ says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 35 “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore you also bearyour lewdness and your prostitution.’” 
\v 36 Yahweh said moreover to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.
\v 37 For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols. They havealso caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through the fire to them to be devoured.
\v 38 Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths.
\v 39 For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; andbehold, they have done this in the middle of my house. 
\v 40 “Furthermore you sisters have sent for men who come from far away, to whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came;for whom you washed yourself, painted your eyes, decorated yourself with ornaments,
\v 41 and sat on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon you set my incense and my oil.
\v 42 “The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her. With men of the common sort were brought drunkards from thewilderness; and they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.
\v 43 Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, ‘Now they will play the prostitute with her, and she with them.’
\v 44 They went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute. So they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.
\v 45 Righteous men will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood; becausethey are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. 
\v 46 “For the Lord Yahweh says: ‘I will bring up a mob against them, and will give them to be tossed back and forth androbbed. 
\v 47 The company will stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords. They will kill their sons and theirdaughters, and burn up their houses with fire. 
\v 48 “‘Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to be lewd like you.
\v 49 They will recompense your lewdness on you, and you will bear the sins of your idols. Then you will know that I am theLord Yahweh.’” 
\c 24 
\v 1 Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 2 “Son of man, write the name of the day, this same day. The king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day.
\v 3 Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says, “Put the cauldron on the fire. Put it on, and also pour water into it. 
\v 4 Gather its pieces into it, even every good piece: the thigh and the shoulder. Fill it with the choice bones. 
\v 5 Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile of wood for the bones under the cauldron. Make it boil well. Yes, let its bones be boiled within it.” 
\v 6 “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Woe to the bloody city, to the cauldron whose rust is in it, and whose rust hasn’t gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece. No lot is fallen on it. 
\v 7 “‘“For her blood is in the middle of her. She set it on the bare rock. She didn’t pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust. 
\v 8 That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood on the bare rock, that it should not be covered.” 
\v 9 “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great. 
\v 10 Heap on the wood. Make the fire hot. Boil the meat well. Make the broth thick, and let the bones be burned. 
\v 11 Then set it empty on its coals, that it may be hot, and its bronze may burn, and that its filthiness may be molten in it, that its rust may be consumed. 
\v 12 She is weary with toil; yet her great rust, rust by fire, doesn’t leave her. 
\v 13 “‘“In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you and you weren’t cleansed, you won’t be cleansed from yourfilthiness any more, until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest.
\v 14 I, Yahweh, have spoken it. It will happen, and I will do it. I won’t go back. I won’t spare. I won’t repent. According toyour ways, and according to your doings, they will judge you,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”
\v 15 Also Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 16 “Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet you shall neither mourn norweep, neither shall your tears run down. 
\v 17 Sigh, but not aloud. Make no mourning for the dead. Bind your headdress on you, and put your sandals on your feet. Don’tcover your lips, and don’t eat mourner’s bread.” 
\v 18 So I spoke to the people in the morning; and at evening my wife died. So I did in the morning as I was commanded.
\v 19 The people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things are to us, that you do so?”
\v 20 Then I said to them, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 21 ‘Speak to the house of Israel, “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, thedesire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall bythe sword. 
\v 22 You will do as I have done. You won’t cover your lips or eat mourner’s bread.
\v 23 Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You won’t mourn or weep; but you will pine away inyour iniquities, and moan one toward another. 
\v 24 Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done, you will do. When this comes, then you will knowthat I am the Lord Yahweh.’”’” 
\v 25 “You, son of man, shouldn’t it be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire oftheir eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters,
\v 26 that in that day he who escapes will come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?
\v 27 In that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped, and you will speak, and be no more mute. So you will be asign to them. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.” 
\c 25 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, set your face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them.
\v 3 Tell the children of Ammon, ‘Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh! The Lord Yahweh says, “Because you said, ‘Aha!’ against mysanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of Judah,when they went into captivity: 
\v 4 therefore, behold, I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession. They will set their encampments inyou, and make their dwellings in you. They will eat your fruit and they will drink your milk.
\v 5 I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a resting place for flocks. Then you will know that I amYahweh.” 
\v 6 For the Lord Yahweh says: “Because you have clapped your hands, stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the contemptof your soul against the land of Israel; 
\v 7 therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand on you, and will deliver you for a plunder to the nations. I will cut youoff from the peoples, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries. I will destroy you. Then you will know that I amYahweh.” 
\v 8 “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because Moab and Seir say, ‘Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations;’
\v 9 therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory ofthe country, Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim, 
\v 10 to the children of the east, to go against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that thechildren of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations. 
\v 11 I will execute judgments on Moab. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”
\v 12 “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended,and taken revenge on them;” 
\v 13 therefore the Lord Yahweh says, “I will stretch out my hand on Edom, and will cut off man and animal from it; and I willmake it desolate from Teman. They will fall by the sword even to Dedan.
\v 14 I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel. They will do in Edom according to my anger and accordingto my wrath. Then they will know my vengeance,” says the Lord Yahweh.
\v 15 “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because the Philistines have taken revenge, and have taken vengeance with contempt of soul todestroy with perpetual hostility;” 
\v 16 therefore the Lord Yahweh says, “Behold, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off theCherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. 
\v 17 I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes. Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I lay myvengeance on them.”’” 
\c 26 
\v 1 In the eleventh year, in the first of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 2 “Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, ‘Aha! She is broken! She who was the gateway of the peoples has beenreturned to me. I will be replenished, now that she is laid waste;’
\v 3 therefore the Lord Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I am against you, Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, asthe sea causes its waves to come up. 
\v 4 They will destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers. I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a barerock. 
\v 5 She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the middle of the sea; for I have spoken it,’ says the Lord Yahweh. ‘Shewill become plunder for the nations. 
\v 6 Her daughters who are in the field will be slain with the sword. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’
\v 7 “For the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will bring on Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north,with horses, with chariots, with horsemen, and an army with many people.
\v 8 He will kill your daughters in the field with the sword. He will make forts against you, cast up a mound against you, andraise up the buckler against you. 
\v 9 He will set his battering engines against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.
\v 10 By reason of the abundance of his horses, their dust will cover you. Your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen,of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he enters into your gates, as men enter into a city which is broken open.
\v 11 He will tread down all your streets with the hoofs of his horses. He will kill your people with the sword. The pillars ofyour strength will go down to the ground. 
\v 12 They will make a plunder of your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise. They will break down your walls, anddestroy your pleasant houses. They will lay your stones, your timber, and your dust in the middle of the waters.
\v 13 I will cause the noise of your songs to cease. The sound of your harps won’t be heard any more.
\v 14 I will make you a bare rock. You will be a place for the spreading of nets. You will be built no more; for I Yahweh havespoken it,’ says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 15 “The Lord Yahweh says to Tyre: ‘Won’t the islands shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when theslaughter is made within you? 
\v 16 Then all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off theirembroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling. They will sit on the ground, and will tremble every moment,and be astonished at you. 
\v 17 They will take up a lamentation over you, and tell you, “How you are destroyed, who were inhabited by seafaring men, the renowned city, who was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, who caused their terror to be on all who lived there!” 
\v 18 Now the islands will tremble in the day of your fall. Yes, the islands that are in the sea will be dismayed at your departure.’
\v 19 “For the Lord Yahweh says: ‘When I make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I bring up thedeep on you, and the great waters cover you; 
\v 20 then I will bring you down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make you dwell in thelower parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with those who go down to the pit, that you be not inhabited;and I will set glory in the land of the living. 
\v 21 I will make you a terror, and you will no more have any being. Though you are sought for, yet you will never be foundagain,’ says the Lord Yahweh.” 
\c 27 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, 
\v 2 “You, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre; 
\v 3 and tell Tyre, ‘You who dwell at the entry of the sea, who are the merchant of the peoples to many islands, the LordYahweh says: “You, Tyre, have said, ‘I am perfect in beauty.’ 
\v 4 Your borders are in the heart of the seas. Your builders have perfected your beauty. 
\v 5 They have made all your planks of cypress trees from Senir. They have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
\v 6 They have made your oars of the oaks of Bashan. They have made your benches of ivory inlaid in cypress wood from the islands of Kittim.
\v 7 Your sail was of fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt, that it might be to you for a banner. Blue and purple from the islands of Elishah was your awning.
\v 8 The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers. Your wise men, Tyre, were in you. They were your pilots. 
\v 9 The old men of Gebal and its wise men were your repairers of ship seams in you. All the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to deal in your merchandise. 
\v 10 “‘“Persia, Lud, and Put were in your army, your men of war. They hung the shield and helmet in you. They showed your beauty. 
\v 11 The men of Arvad with your army were on your walls all around, and valiant men were in your towers. They hung their shields on your walls all around. They have perfected your beauty. 
\v 12 “‘“Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches. They traded for your wares with silver,iron, tin, and lead. 
\v 13 “‘“Javan, Tubal, and Meshech were your traders. They traded the persons of men and vessels of bronze for yourmerchandise. 
\v 14 “‘“They of the house of Togarmah traded for your wares with horses, war horses, and mules.
\v 15 “‘“The men of Dedan traded with you. Many islands were the market of your hand. They brought you horns of ivory and ebonyin exchange. 
\v 16 “‘“Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of your handiworks. They traded for your wares with emeralds,purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies. 
\v 17 “‘“Judah and the land of Israel were your traders. They traded wheat of Minnith, confections, honey, oil, and balm foryour merchandise. 
\v 18 “‘“Damascus was your merchant for the multitude of your handiworks, by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches,with the wine of Helbon, and white wool. 
\v 19 “‘“Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for your wares: bright iron, cassia, and calamus were among your merchandise.
\v 20 “‘“Dedan was your trafficker in precious cloths for riding.
\v 21 “‘“Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar were the merchants of your hand; in lambs, rams, and goats. In these, they wereyour merchants. 
\v 22 “‘“The traders of Sheba and Raamah were your traders. They traded for your wares with the chief of all spices, and withall precious stones, and gold. 
\v 23 “‘“Haran, Canneh, and Eden, the traders of Sheba, Asshur and Chilmad, were your traders.
\v 24 These were your traders in choice wares, in wrappings of blue and embroidered work, and in chests of rich clothing, boundwith cords and made of cedar, among your merchandise. 
\v 25 “‘“The ships of Tarshish were your caravans for your merchandise. You were replenished and made very glorious in the heart of the seas. 
\v 26 Your rowers have brought you into great waters. The east wind has broken you in the heart of the seas. 
\v 27 Your riches, your wares, your merchandise, your mariners, your pilots, your repairers of ship seams, the dealers in your merchandise, and all your men of war, who are in you, with all your company which is among you, will fall into the heart of the seas in the day of your ruin.
\v 28 At the sound of the cry of your pilots, the pasture lands will shake. 
\v 29 All who handle the oars, the mariners and all the pilots of the sea, will come down from their ships. They will stand on the land, 
\v 30 and will cause their voice to be heard over you, and will cry bitterly. They will cast up dust on their heads. They will wallow in the ashes. 
\v 31 They will make themselves bald for you, and clothe themselves with sackcloth. They will weep for you in bitterness of soul, with bitter mourning. 
\v 32 In their wailing they will take up a lamentation for you, and lament over you, saying, ‘Who is there like Tyre, like her who is brought to silence in the middle of the sea?’
\v 33 When your wares went out of the seas, you filled many peoples. You enriched the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise. 
\v 34 In the time that you were broken by the seas, in the depths of the waters, your merchandise and all your company fell within you. 
\v 35 All the inhabitants of the islands are astonished at you, and their kings are horribly afraid. They are troubled in their face. 
\v 36 The merchants among the peoples hiss at you. You have become a terror, and you will be no more.”’” 
\c 28 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, tell the prince of Tyre, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because your heart is lifted up, and you have said, ‘I am a god, I sit in the seat of God, in the middle of the seas;’ yet you are man, and not God, though you set your heart as the heart of God— 
\v 3 behold, you are wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that is hidden from you; 
\v 4 by your wisdom and by your understanding you have gotten yourself riches, and have gotten gold and silver into your treasures;

\v 6 “‘therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Because you have set your heart as the heart of God,

\v 9 Will you yet say before him who kills you, ‘I am God’? But you are man, and not God, in the hand of him who wounds you. 
\v 10 You will die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers; for I have spoken it,” says the Lord Yahweh.’” 
\v 11 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 12 “Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and tell him, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “You were the seal of full measure, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. 
\v 13 You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone adorned you: ruby, topaz, emerald, chrysolite, onyx, jasper, sapphire,\f + \fr 28:13 \ft or, lapis lazuli \f* turquoise, and beryl. Gold work of tambourines and of pipes was in you. They were prepared in the day that you were created. 
\v 14 You were the anointed cherub who covers. Then I set you up on the holy mountain of God. You have walked up and down in the middle of the stones of fire.
\v 15 You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you. 
\v 16 By the abundance of your commerce, your insides were filled with violence, and you have sinned. Therefore I have cast you as profane out of God’s mountain. I have destroyed you, covering cherub, from the middle of the stones of fire. 
\v 17 Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty. You have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor. I have cast you to the ground. I have laid you before kings, that they may see you. 
\v 18 By the multitude of your iniquities, in the unrighteousness of your commerce, you have profaned your sanctuaries. Therefore I have brought out a fire from the middle of you. It has devoured you. I have turned you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all those who see you. 
\v 19 All those who know you among the peoples will be astonished at you. You have become a terror, and you will exist no more.”’” 
\v 20 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 21 “Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,
\v 22 and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against you, Sidon. I will be glorified among you. Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have executed judgments in her, and am sanctified in her. 
\v 23 For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets. The wounded will fall within her, with the sword on her on every side. Then they will know that I am Yahweh. 
\v 24 “‘“There will be no more a pricking brier to the house of Israel, nor a hurting thorn of any that are around them thatscorned them. Then they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.” 
\v 25 “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “When I have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and amsanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then they will dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob.

\c 29 
\v 1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 2 “Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.
\v 3 Speak and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lies in the middle of his rivers, that has said, ‘My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.’ 
\v 4 I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales. I will bring you up out of the middle of your rivers, with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales.
\v 5 I’ll cast you out into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers. You’ll fall on the open field. You won’t be brought together or gathered. I have given you for food to the animals of the earth and to the birds of the sky. 
\v 6 “‘“All the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
\v 7 When they took hold of you by your hand, you broke, and tore all their shoulders. When they leaned on you, you broke, andparalyzed all of their thighs.” 
\v 8 “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I will bring a sword on you, and will cut off man and animal from you.
\v 9 The land of Egypt will be a desolation and a waste. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.\p “‘“Because he has said, ‘The river is mine, and I have made it;’
\v 10 therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your rivers. I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste anddesolation, from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia.
\v 11 No foot of man will pass through it, nor will any animal foot pass through it. It won’t be inhabited for forty years.
\v 12 I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the middle of the countries that are desolate. Her cities among the citiesthat are laid waste will be a desolation forty years. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse themthrough the countries.” 
\v 13 “‘For the Lord Yahweh says: “At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they werescattered. 
\v 14 I will reverse the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of theirbirth. They will be a lowly kingdom, there. 
\v 15 It will be the lowest of the kingdoms. It won’t lift itself up above the nations any more. I will diminish them, so thatthey will no longer rule over the nations. 
\v 16 It will no longer be the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to memory, when they turn to look afterthem. Then they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.”’” 
\v 17 It came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me,saying, 
\v 18 “Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre. Every head was madebald, and every shoulder was worn; yet he had no wages, nor did his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served againstit. 
\v 19 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He will carryoff her multitude, take her plunder, and take her prey. That will be the wages for his army.
\v 20 I have given him the land of Egypt as his payment for which he served, because they worked for me,’ says the Lord Yahweh.
\v 21 “In that day I will cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth among them. Then they willknow that I am Yahweh.” 
\c 30 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, prophesy, and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Wail, ‘Alas for the day!’ 
\v 3 For the day is near, even Yahweh’s day is near. It will be a day of clouds, a time of the nations. 
\v 4 A sword will come on Egypt, and anguish will be in Ethiopia, when the slain fall in Egypt. They take away her multitude, and her foundations are broken down. 
\v 5 “‘“Ethiopia, Put, Lud, all the mixed people, Cub, and the children of the land that is allied with them, will fall withthem by the sword.” 
\v 6 “‘Yahweh says: “They also who uphold Egypt will fall. The pride of her power will come down. They will fall by the sword in it from the tower of Seveneh,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 7 “They will be desolate in the middle of the countries that are desolate. Her cities will be among the cities that are wasted. 
\v 8 They will know that I am Yahweh when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed. 
\v 9 “‘“In that day messengers will go out from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid. There will beanguish on them, as in the day of Egypt; for, behold, it comes.”
\v 10 “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. 
\v 11 He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, will be brought in to destroy the land. They will draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain. 
\v 12 I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men. I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, Yahweh, have spoken it.” 
\v 13 “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis. There will be no more a prince from the land of Egypt. I will put a fear in the land of Egypt. 
\v 14 I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments on No. 
\v 15 I will pour my wrath on Sin, the stronghold of Egypt. I will cut off the multitude of No. 
\v 16 I will set a fire in Egypt Sin will be in great anguish. No will be broken up. Memphis will have adversaries in the daytime. 
\v 17 The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth will fall by the sword. They will go into captivity. 
\v 18 At Tehaphnehes also the day will withdraw itself, when I break the yokes of Egypt, there. The pride of her power will cease in her. As for her, a cloud will cover her, and her daughters will go into captivity. 
\v 19 Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”’” 
\v 20 In the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 21 “Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Behold, it has not been bound up, to apply medicines, to puta bandage to bind it, that it become strong to hold the sword. 
\v 22 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong arm, andthat which was broken. I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
\v 23 I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
\v 24 I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand; but I will break the arms of Pharaoh,and he will groan before the king of Babylon with the groaning of a mortally wounded man.
\v 25 I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh will fall down. Then they will know that I amYahweh, when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he stretches it out on the land of Egypt.
\v 26 I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries. Then they will know that I amYahweh.’” 
\c 31 
\v 1 In the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 2 “Son of man, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his multitude: ‘Whom are you like in your greatness? 
\v 3 Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches, and with a forest-like shade, of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs. 
\v 4 The waters nourished it. The deep made it to grow. Its rivers ran all around its plantation; and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field. 
\v 5 Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied. Its branches became long by reason of many waters, when it spread them out. 
\v 6 All the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs. Under its branches, all the animals of the field gave birth to their young. All great nations lived under its shadow. 
\v 7 Thus was it beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its root was by many waters. 
\v 8 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it. The cypress trees were not like its boughs. The pine trees were not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty.
\v 9 I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.’ 
\v 10 “Therefore thus said the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because you are exalted in stature, and he has set his top among the thick boughs,and his heart is lifted up in his height; 
\v 11 I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations. He will surely deal with him. I have driven himout for his wickedness. 
\v 12 Strangers, the tyrants of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him. His branches have fallen on the mountains andin all the valleys and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land. All the peoples of the earth have gone downfrom his shadow, and have left him. 
\v 13 All the birds of the sky will dwell on his ruin, and all the animals of the field will be on his branches;
\v 14 to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, and don’t set their top among thethick boughs. Their mighty ones don’t stand up on their height, even all who drink water; for they are all delivered to death,to the lower parts of the earth, among the children of men, with those who go down to the pit.’
\v 15 “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘In the day when he went down to Sheol\f + \fr 31:15 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.\f* I caused a mourning. I covered the deep for him, and I restrained itsrivers. The great waters were stopped. I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
\v 16 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down toSheol\f + \fr 31:16 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.\f* with those who descend into the pit. All the trees of Eden, thechoice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the lower parts of the earth.
\v 17 They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword; yes, those who were his arm, who lived underhis shadow in the middle of the nations. 
\v 18 “‘To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet you will be brought down with thetrees of Eden to the lower parts of the earth. You will lie in the middle of the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by thesword. “‘This is Pharaoh and all his multitude,’ says the Lord Yahweh.”
\c 32 
\v 1 In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 2 ‘Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tell him, “You were likened to a young lion of the nations; yet you are as a monster in the seas. You broke out with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.” 
\v 3 The Lord Yahweh says: “I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples; and they will bring you up in my net. 
\v 4 I will leave you on the land. I will cast you out on the open field, and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you. I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you. 
\v 5 I will lay your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your height. 
\v 6 I will also water the land in which you swim with your blood, even to the mountains. The watercourses will be full of you. 
\v 7 When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens and make its stars dark. I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon won’t give its light. 
\v 8 I will make all the bright lights of the sky dark over you, and set darkness on your land,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 9 “I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries which you have not known. 
\v 10 Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you, and their kings will be horribly afraid for you, when I brandish my sword before them. They will tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.” 
\v 11 For the Lord Yahweh says: “The sword of the king of Babylon will come on you. 
\v 12 I will cause your multitude to fall by the swords of the mighty. They are all the ruthless of the nations. They will bring the pride of Egypt to nothing, and all its multitude will be destroyed. 
\v 13 I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters. The foot of man won’t trouble them any more, nor will the hoofs of animals trouble them. 
\v 14 Then I will make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 15 “When I make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that of which it was full, when I strike all those who dwell therein, then they will know that I am Yahweh. 
\v 16 “‘“This is the lamentation with which they will lament. The daughters of the nations will lament with this. They willlament with it over Egypt, and over all her multitude,” says the Lord Yahweh.’” 
\v 17 Also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 18 “Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her and the daughters of the famous nations, tothe lower parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.
\v 19 Whom do you pass in beauty? Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.
\v 20 They will fall among those who are slain by the sword. She is delivered to the sword. Draw her away with all hermultitudes. 
\v 21 The strong among the mighty will speak to him out of the middle of Sheol\f + \fr 32:21 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.\f* with those who help him. They have gone down. The uncircumcised liestill, slain by the sword. 
\v 22 “Asshur is there with all her company. Her graves are all around her. All of them slain, fallen by the sword;
\v 23 whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is around her grave; all of them slain, fallen bythe sword, who caused terror in the land of the living. 
\v 24 “There is Elam and all her multitude around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone downuncircumcised into the lower parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shamewith those who go down to the pit. 
\v 25 They have set her a bed among the slain with all her multitude. Her graves are around her; all of them uncircumcised,slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with those who godown to the pit. He is put among those who are slain. 
\v 26 “There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude. Their graves are around them, all of them uncircumcised, slain by thesword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living. 
\v 27 They will not lie with the mighty who are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons ofwar, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are on their bones; for they were the terror of themighty in the land of the living. 
\v 28 “But you will be broken among the uncircumcised, and will lie with those who are slain by the sword.
\v 29 “There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword. Theywill lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the pit.
\v 30 “There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain. They are putto shame in the terror which they caused by their might. They lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and beartheir shame with those who go down to the pit. 
\v 31 “Pharaoh will see them, and will be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword,”says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 32 “For I have put his terror in the land of the living. He will be laid among the uncircumcised, with those who are slainby the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude,” says the Lord Yahweh.
\c 33 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and tell them, ‘When I bring the sword on a land, and the people of theland take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman;
\v 3 if, when he sees the sword come on the land, he blows the trumpet, and warns the people;
\v 4 then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and doesn’t heed the warning, if the sword comes, and takes him away, hisblood will be on his own head. 
\v 5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and didn’t take warning. His blood will be on him; whereas if he had heeded thewarning, he would have delivered his soul. 
\v 6 But if the watchman sees the sword come, and doesn’t blow the trumpet, and the people aren’t warned, and the sword comes,and takes any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.’
\v 7 “So you, son of man: I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and givethem warnings from me. 
\v 8 When I tell the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,’ and you don’t speak to warn the wicked from his way; thatwicked man will die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at your hand.
\v 9 Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he doesn’t turn from his way; he will die in hisiniquity, but you have delivered your soul. 
\v 10 “You, son of man, tell the house of Israel: ‘You say this, “Our transgressions and our sins are on us, and we pine awayin them. How then can we live?”’ 
\v 11 Tell them, ‘“As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turnfrom his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why will you die, house of Israel?”’
\v 12 “You, son of man, tell the children of your people, ‘The righteousness of the righteous will not deliver him in the dayof his disobedience. And as for the wickedness of the wicked, he will not fall by it in the day that he turns from hiswickedness; neither will he who is righteous be able to live by it in the day that he sins.
\v 13 When I tell the righteous that he will surely live; if he trusts in his righteousness, and commits iniquity, none of hisrighteous deeds will be remembered; but he will die in his iniquity that he has committed.
\v 14 Again, when I say to the wicked, “You will surely die;” if he turns from his sin, and does that which is lawful andright; 
\v 15 if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committingno iniquity; he will surely live. He will not die. 
\v 16 None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him. He has done that which is lawful and right. Hewill surely live. 
\v 17 “‘Yet the children of your people say, “The way of the Lord is not fair;” but as for them, their way is not fair.
\v 18 When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he will even die therein.
\v 19 When the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and right, he will live by it.
\v 20 Yet you say, “The way of the Lord is not fair.” House of Israel, I will judge every one of you after his ways.’” 
\v 21 In the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, one who had escaped out ofJerusalem came to me, saying, “The city has been defeated!” 
\v 22 Now Yahweh’s hand had been on me in the evening, before he who had escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until hecame to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute.
\v 23 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 24 “Son of man, those who inhabit the waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, ‘Abraham was one, and he inheritedthe land; but we are many. The land is given us for inheritance.’
\v 25 Therefore tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “You eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood.So should you possess the land? 
\v 26 You stand on your sword, you work abomination, and every one of you defiles his neighbor’s wife. So should you possessthe land?”’ 
\v 27 “You shall tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “As I live, surely those who are in the waste places will fall by the sword.I will give he who is in the open field to the animals to be devoured; and those who are in the strongholds and in the caveswill die of the pestilence. 
\v 28 I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment. The pride of her power will cease. The mountains of Israel will bedesolate, so that no one will pass through. 
\v 29 Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all theirabominations which they have committed.”’ 
\v 30 “As for you, son of man, the children of your people talk about you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, andspeak to one another, everyone to his brother, saying, ‘Please come and hear what the word is that comes out from Yahweh.’
\v 31 They come to you as the people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but don’t do them;for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their gain.
\v 32 Behold, you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; forthey hear your words, but they don’t do them. 
\v 33 “When this comes to pass—behold, it comes—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”
\c 34 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and tell them, even the shepherds, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Shouldn’t the shepherds feed the sheep?
\v 3 You eat the fat. You clothe yourself with the wool. You kill the fatlings, but you don’t feed the sheep.
\v 4 You haven’t strengthened the diseased. You haven’t healed that which was sick. You haven’t bound up that which was broken.You haven’t brought back that which was driven away. You haven’t sought that which was lost, but you have ruled over them withforce and with rigor. 
\v 5 They were scattered, because there was no shepherd. They became food to all the animals of the field, and were scattered.
\v 6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill. Yes, my sheep were scattered on all the surface ofthe earth. There was no one who searched or sought.” 
\v 7 “‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word: 
\v 8 “As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “surely because my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the animals ofthe field, because there was no shepherd. My shepherds didn’t search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and didn’tfeed my sheep.” 
\v 9 Therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word: 
\v 10 The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against the shepherds. I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to ceasefrom feeding the sheep. The shepherds won’t feed themselves any more. I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they maynot be food for them.” 
\v 11 “‘For the Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.
\v 12 As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so I will seek out mysheep. I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
\v 13 I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. Iwill feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
\v 14 I will feed them with good pasture; and their fold will be on the mountains of the height of Israel. There they will liedown in a good fold. They will feed on fat pasture on the mountains of Israel.
\v 15 I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down,” says the Lord Yahweh.
\v 16 “I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken,and will strengthen that which was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong. I will feed them in justice.”’
\v 17 “As for you, O my flock, the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the male goats.
\v 18 Does it seem a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue ofyour pasture? And to have drunk of the clear waters, but must you foul the residue with your feet?
\v 19 As for my sheep, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which you have fouled with yourfeet.’ 
\v 20 “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says to them: ‘Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
\v 21 Because you thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, until you have scattered themabroad; 
\v 22 therefore I will save my flock, and they will no more be a prey. I will judge between sheep and sheep.
\v 23 I will set up one shepherd over them, and he will feed them, even my servant David. He will feed them, and he will betheir shepherd. 
\v 24 I, Yahweh, will be their God, and my servant David prince among them. I, Yahweh, have spoken it.
\v 25 “‘I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil animals to cease out of the land. They will dwellsecurely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. 
\v 26 I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing. I will cause the shower to come down in its season. There willbe showers of blessing. 
\v 27 The tree of the field will yield its fruit, and the earth will yield its increase, and they will be secure in their land.Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand ofthose who made slaves of them. 
\v 28 They will no more be a prey to the nations, neither will the animals of the earth devour them; but they will dwellsecurely, and no one will make them afraid. 
\v 29 I will raise up to them a plantation for renown, and they will no more be consumed with famine in the land, and not bearthe shame of the nations any more. 
\v 30 They will know that I, Yahweh, their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the LordYahweh. 
\v 31 You my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God,’ says the Lord Yahweh.”
\c 35 
\v 1 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
\v 3 and tell it, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you. Iwill make you a desolation and an astonishment. 
\v 4 I will lay your cities waste, and you will be desolate. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.
\v 5 “‘“Because you have had a perpetual hostility, and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in thetime of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end; 
\v 6 therefore, as I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “I will prepare you for blood, and blood will pursue you. Since you have nothated blood, therefore blood will pursue you. 
\v 7 Thus I will make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation. I will cut off from it him who passes through and him whoreturns. 
\v 8 I will fill its mountains with its slain. The slain with the sword will fall in your hills and in your valleys and in allyour watercourses. 
\v 9 I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.
\v 10 “‘“Because you have said, ‘These two nations and these two countries will be mine, and we will possess it;’ whereasYahweh was there: 
\v 11 therefore, as I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “I will do according to your anger, and according to your envy which youhave shown out of your hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them when I judge you.
\v 12 You will know that I, Yahweh, have heard all your insults which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, ‘They have been laid desolate. They have been given us to devour.’
\v 13 You have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me. I have heard it.”
\v 14 The Lord Yahweh says: “When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.
\v 15 As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, so I will do to you. You will bedesolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’”
\c 36 
\v 1 You, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, “You mountains of Israel, hear Yahweh’s word.
\v 2 The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Because the enemy has said against you, “Aha!” and, “The ancient high places are ours inpossession!”’ 
\v 3 therefore prophesy, and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed youup on every side, that you might be a possession to the residue of the nations, and you are taken up in the lips of talkers,and the evil report of the people;” 
\v 4 therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh: The Lord Yahweh says to the mountains and to thehills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which have become aprey and derision to the residue of the nations that are all around;
\v 5 therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the residue of the nations, andagainst all Edom, that have appointed my land to themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite ofsoul, to cast it out for a prey.”’ 
\v 6 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and tell the mountains, the hills, the watercourses and the valleys, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because you have borne the shame of the nations.”
\v 7 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “I have sworn, ‘Surely the nations that are around you will bear their shame.’
\v 8 “‘“But you, mountains of Israel, you shall shoot out your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they areat hand to come. 
\v 9 For, behold, I am for you, and I will come to you, and you will be tilled and sown.
\v 10 I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel, even all of it. The cities will be inhabited, and the waste placeswill be built. 
\v 11 I will multiply man and animal on you. They will increase and be fruitful. I will cause you to be inhabited as you werebefore, and you will do better than at your beginnings. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.
\v 12 Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, even my people Israel. They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance,and you will never again bereave them of their children.” 
\v 13 “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because they say to you, ‘You are a devourer of men, and have been a bereaver of your nation;’
\v 14 therefore you shall devour men no more, and not bereave your nation any more,” says the Lord Yahweh.
\v 15 “I won’t let you hear the shame of the nations any more. You won’t bear the reproach of the peoples any more, and youwon’t cause your nation to stumble any more,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”
\v 16 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 17 “Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and by their deeds. Theirway before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.
\v 18 Therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land, and because they had defiledit with their idols. 
\v 19 I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. I judged them according to their wayand according to their deeds. 
\v 20 When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, ‘These are Yahweh’speople, and have left his land.’ 
\v 21 But I had respect for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went.
\v 22 “Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “I don’t do this for your sake, house of Israel, but for myholy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went.
\v 23 I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned among them. Then thenations will know that I am Yahweh,” says the Lord Yahweh, “when I am proven holy in you before their eyes.
\v 24 “‘“For I will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your ownland. 
\v 25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness, and from all youridols. 
\v 26 I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take away the stony heart out of yourflesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. 
\v 27 I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes. You will keep my ordinances and do them.
\v 28 You will dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers. You will be my people, and I will be your God.
\v 29 I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine on you.
\v 30 I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field, that you may receive no more the reproach of famineamong the nations. 
\v 31 “‘“Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves in your ownsight for your iniquities and for your abominations. 
\v 32 I don’t do this for your sake,” says the Lord Yahweh. “Let it be known to you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways,house of Israel.” 
\v 33 “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabitedand the waste places will be built. 
\v 34 The land that was desolate will be tilled instead of being a desolation in the sight of all who passed by.
\v 35 They will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden. The waste, desolate, and ruined citiesare fortified and inhabited.’ 
\v 36 Then the nations that are left around you will know that I, Yahweh, have built the ruined places, and planted that whichwas desolate. I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and I will do it.” 
\v 37 “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “For this, moreover, I will be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I willincrease them with men like a flock. 
\v 38 As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so the waste cities will be filled withflocks of men. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’” 
\c 37 
\v 1 Yahweh’s hand was on me, and he brought me out in Yahweh’s Spirit, and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it wasfull of bones. 
\v 2 He caused me to pass by them all around: and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold, they were verydry. 
\v 3 He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I answered, “Lord Yahweh, you know.” 
\v 4 Again he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them, ‘You dry bones, hear Yahweh’s word.
\v 5 The Lord Yahweh says to these bones: “Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you will live.
\v 6 I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you willlive. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”’” 
\v 7 So I prophesied as I was commanded. As I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, there was an earthquake. Then thebones came together, bone to its bone. 
\v 8 I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath inthem. 
\v 9 Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell the wind, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Come from thefour winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.”’”
\v 10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, anexceedingly great army. 
\v 11 Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up,and our hope is lost. We are completely cut off.’ 
\v 12 Therefore prophesy, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up outof your graves, my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.
\v 13 You will know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, my people.
\v 14 I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live. Then I will place you in your own land; and you will know that I, Yahweh,have spoken it and performed it,” says Yahweh.’” 
\v 15 Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, 
\v 16 “You, son of man, take one stick, and write on it, ‘For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions.’ Then takeanother stick, and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions.’
\v 17 Then join them for yourself to one another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.
\v 18 “When the children of your people speak to you, saying, ‘Won’t you show us what you mean by these?’
\v 19 tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and thetribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they willbe one in my hand. 
\v 20 The sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.”’
\v 21 Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, where they havegone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land.
\v 22 I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. One king will be king to them all. They will nolonger be two nations. They won’t be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.
\v 23 They won’t defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of theirtransgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. Sothey will be my people, and I will be their God. 
\v 24 “‘“My servant David will be king over them. They all will have one shepherd. They will also walk in my ordinances, andobserve my statutes, and do them. 
\v 25 They will dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers lived. They will dwell therein,they, and their children, and their children’s children, forever. David my servant will be their prince forever.
\v 26 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them. It will be an everlasting covenant with them. I will place them,multiply them, and will set my sanctuary among them forever more.
\v 27 My tent also will be with them. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
\v 28 The nations will know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is among them forever more.”’”
\c 38 
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy againsthim, 
\v 3 and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against you, Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.
\v 4 I will turn you around, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, with all your army, horses and horsemen,all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords;
\v 5 Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
\v 6 Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes; even manypeoples with you. 
\v 7 “‘“Be prepared, yes, prepare yourself, you, and all your companies who are assembled to you, and be a guard to them.
\v 8 After many days you will be visited. In the latter years you will come into the land that is brought back from the sword,that is gathered out of many peoples, on the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought out ofthe peoples, and they will dwell securely, all of them. 
\v 9 You will ascend. You will come like a storm. You will be like a cloud to cover the land, you, and all your hordes, andmany peoples with you.” 
\v 10 “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “It will happen in that day that things will come into your mind, and you will devise an evilplan. 
\v 11 You will say, ‘I will go up to the land of unwalled villages. I will go to those who are at rest, who dwell securely, allof them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,
\v 12 to take the plunder and to take prey; to turn your hand against the waste places that are inhabited, and against thepeople who are gathered out of the nations, who have gotten livestock and goods, who dwell in the middle of the earth.’
\v 13 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions of it, will ask you, ‘Have you come to take theplunder? Have you assembled your company to take the prey, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, totake great plunder?’”’ 
\v 14 “Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and tell Gog, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “In that day when my people Israel dwellssecurely, will you not know it? 
\v 15 You will come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north, you, and many peoples with you, all of them ridingon horses, a great company and a mighty army. 
\v 16 You will come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land. It will happen in the latter days, that I willbring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when I am sanctified in you, Gog, before their eyes.”
\v 17 “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Are you he of whom I spoke in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied inthose days for years that I would bring you against them? 
\v 18 It will happen in that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel,” says the Lord Yahweh, “that my wrath will come upinto my nostrils. 
\v 19 For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath I have spoken. Surely in that day there will be a great shaking in theland of Israel; 
\v 20 so that the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the animals of the field, all creeping things who creep on the earth,and all the men who are on the surface of the earth will shake at my presence. Then the mountains will be thrown down, thesteep places will fall, and every wall will fall to the ground. 
\v 21 I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains,” says the Lord Yahweh. “Every man’s sword will be against hisbrother. 
\v 22 I will enter into judgment with him with pestilence and with blood. I will rain on him, and on his hordes, and on themany peoples who are with him, an overflowing shower, with great hailstones, fire, and sulfur.
\v 23 I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations. Then they will knowthat I am Yahweh.”’ 
\c 39 
\v 1 “You, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against you, Gog, prince of Rosh,Meshech, and Tubal. 
\v 2 I will turn you around, and will lead you on, and will cause you to come up from the uttermost parts of the north; and Iwill bring you onto the mountains of Israel. 
\v 3 I will strike your bow out of your left hand, and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand.
\v 4 You will fall on the mountains of Israel, you, and all your hordes, and the peoples who are with you. I will give you tothe ravenous birds of every sort, and to the animals of the field to be devoured.

\v 9 “‘“Those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out, and will make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shieldsand the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the war clubs and the spears, and they will make fires with them for sevenyears; 
\v 10 so that they will take no wood out of the field, and not cut down any out of the forests; for they will make fires withthe weapons. They will plunder those who plundered them, and rob those who robbed them,” says the Lord Yahweh.
\v 11 “‘“It will happen in that day, that I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of those who pass throughon the east of the sea; and it will stop those who pass through. They will bury Gog and all his multitude there; and they willcall it ‘The valley of Hamon Gog’. 
\v 12 “‘“The house of Israel will be burying them for seven months, that they may cleanse the land.

\v 16 Hamonah will also be the name of a city. Thus they will cleanse the land.”’
\v 17 “You, son of man, the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Speak to the birds of every sort, and to every animal of the field, “Assembleyourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice on themountains of Israel, that you may eat meat and drink blood.

\v 19 You shall eat fat until you are full, and drink blood until you are drunk, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed foryou. 
\v 20 You shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war,” says the LordYahweh.’ 
\v 21 “I will set my glory among the nations. Then all the nations will see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand thatI have laid on them. 
\v 22 So the house of Israel will know that I am Yahweh their God, from that day and forward.
\v 23 The nations will know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed againstme, and I hid my face from them; so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they all fell by the sword.
\v 24 I did to them according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions. I hid my face from them.
\v 25 “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Now I will reverse the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel.I will be jealous for my holy name. 
\v 26 They will bear their shame, and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they dwell securelyin their land, and no one will make them afraid, 
\v 27 when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in themin the sight of many nations. 
\v 28 They will know that I am Yahweh their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and havegathered them to their own land. Then I will leave none of them captive any more.
\v 29 I won’t hide my face from them any more; for I have poured out my Spirit on the house of Israel,’ says the Lord Yahweh.”
\c 40 
\v 1 In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenthyear after that the city was struck, in the same day, Yahweh’s hand was on me, and he brought me there.
\v 2 In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which wassomething like the frame of a city to the south. 
\v 3 He brought me there; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flaxin his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. 
\v 4 The man said to me, “Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I will showyou; for you have been brought here so that I may show them to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.”
\v 5 Behold, there was a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed sixcubits\f + \fr 40:5 \ft A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18inches or 46 centimeters. Thus, a 6-cubit measuring reed would have been about 3 yards or about 2.74 meterslong.\f* long, of a cubit and a hand width each. So he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, onereed. 
\v 6 Then he came to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate, onereed wide; and the other threshold, one reed wide. 
\v 7 Every lodge was one reed long and one reed wide. Between the lodges was five cubits. The threshold of the gate by theporch of the gate toward the house was one reed. 
\v 8 He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.
\v 9 Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward thehouse. 
\v 10 The lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side. The three of them were of one measure.The posts had one measure on this side and on that side. 
\v 11 He measured the width of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;
\v 12 and a border before the lodges, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubitson this side, and six cubits on that side. 
\v 13 He measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits, door againstdoor. 
\v 14 He also made posts, sixty cubits; and the court reached to the posts, around the gate.
\v 15 From the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.
\v 16 There were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate all around, and likewise to the arches.Windows were around inward. Palm trees were on each post. 
\v 17 Then he brought me into the outer court. Behold, there were rooms and a pavement made for the court all around. Thirtyrooms were on the pavement. 
\v 18 The pavement was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.
\v 19 Then he measured the width from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, one hundredcubits, both on the east and on the north. 
\v 20 He measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court which faces toward the north.
\v 21 The lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side. Its posts and its arches were the same as the measure ofthe first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.
\v 22 Its windows, its arches, and its palm trees were the same as the measure of the gate which faces toward the east. Theywent up to it by seven steps. Its arches were before them. 
\v 23 There was a gate to the inner court facing the other gate, on the north and on the east. He measured one hundred cubitsfrom gate to gate. 
\v 24 He led me toward the south; and behold, there was a gate toward the south. He measured its posts and its arches accordingto these measurements. 
\v 25 There were windows in it and in its arches all around, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the widthtwenty-five cubits. 
\v 26 There were seven steps to go up to it, and its arches were before them. It had palm trees, one on this side, and anotheron that side, on its posts. 
\v 27 There was a gate to the inner court toward the south. He measured one hundred cubits from gate to gate toward the south.
\v 28 Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate. He measured the south gate according to these measurements;
\v 29 with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its archesall around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide.
\v 30 There were arches all around, twenty-five cubits long, and five cubits wide.
\v 31 Its arches were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts. The ascent to it had eight steps.
\v 32 He brought me into the inner court toward the east. He measured the gate according to these measurements;
\v 33 with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its archesall around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide.
\v 34 Its arches were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it hadeight steps. 
\v 35 He brought me to the north gate, and he measured it according to these measurements;
\v 36 its lodges, its posts, and its arches. There were windows in it all around. The length was fifty cubits and the widthtwenty-five cubits. 
\v 37 Its posts were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it hadeight steps. 
\v 38 A room with its door was by the posts at the gates. They washed the burnt offering there.
\v 39 In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, on which to kill the burnt offering,the sin offering, and the trespass offering. 
\v 40 On the one side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the otherside, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables. 
\v 41 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate: eight tables, on which they killedthe sacrifices. 
\v 42 There were four tables for the burnt offering, of cut stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide, andone cubit high. They laid the instruments with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice on them.
\v 43 The hooks, a hand width long, were fastened within all around. The meat of the offering was on the tables.
\v 44 Outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate. Theyfaced toward the south. One at the side of the east gate faced toward the north.
\v 45 He said to me, “This room, which faces toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the duty of the house.
\v 46 The room which faces toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the duty of the altar. These are the sons ofZadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Yahweh to minister to him.”
\v 47 He measured the court, one hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits wide, square. The altar was before the house.
\v 48 Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and fivecubits on that side. The width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.
\v 49 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; even by the steps by which they went up to it.There were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.
\c 41 
\v 1 He brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits wide on the one side, and six cubits wide on the otherside, which was the width of the tent. 
\v 2 The width of the entrance was ten cubits;\f + \fr 41:2 \ft A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to theelbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.\f* and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side,and five cubits on the other side. He measured its length, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits.
\v 3 Then he went inward and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the width of theentrance, seven cubits. 
\v 4 He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the temple. He said to me, “This is the mostholy place.” 
\v 5 Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of every side room, four cubits, all around the house onevery side. 
\v 6 The side rooms were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order. They entered into the wall which belonged tothe house for the side rooms all around, that they might be supported, and not penetrate the wall of the house.
\v 7 The side rooms were wider on the higher levels, because the walls were narrower at the higher levels. Therefore the widthof the house increased upward; and so one went up from the lowest level to the highest through the middle level.
\v 8 I saw also that the house had a raised base all around. The foundations of the side rooms were a full reed of six greatcubits. 
\v 9 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side rooms, on the outside, was five cubits. That which was left was theplace of the side rooms that belonged to the house. 
\v 10 Between the rooms was a width of twenty cubits around the house on every side.
\v 11 The doors of the side rooms were toward an open area that was left, one door toward the north, and another door towardthe south. The width of the open area was five cubits all around.
\v 12 The building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of thebuilding was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.
\v 13 So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, one hundredcubits long; 
\v 14 also the width of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, one hundred cubits.
\v 15 He measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back, and its galleries on the one sideand on the other side, one hundred cubits from the inner temple, and the porches of the court
\v 16 the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries around on their three stories, opposite the threshold, withwood ceilings all around, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),
\v 17 to the space above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall all around inside and outside, bymeasure. 
\v 18 It was made with cherubim and palm trees. A palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;
\v 19 so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palmtree on the other side. It was made like this through all the house all around.
\v 20 Cherubim and palm trees were made from the ground to above the door. The wall of the temple was like this.
\v 21 As for the temple, the door posts were squared. As for the face of the sanctuary, its appearance was as the appearance ofthe temple. 
\v 22 The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its length, and its walls were of wood.He said to me, “This is the table that is before Yahweh.” 
\v 23 The temple and the sanctuary had two doors. 
\v 24 The doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves: two for the one door, and two leaves for the other.
\v 25 There were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like those made on the walls. There was athreshold of wood on the face of the porch outside. 
\v 26 There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch. This is howthe side rooms of the house and the thresholds were arranged. 
\c 42 
\v 1 Then he brought me out into the outer court, the way toward the north. Then he brought me into the room that was oppositethe separate place, and which was opposite the building toward the north.
\v 2 Before the length of one hundred cubits\f + \fr 42:2 \ft A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to theelbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.\f* was the north door, and the width was fifty cubits.
\v 3 Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court,was gallery against gallery in the third floor. 
\v 4 Before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits’ width inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.
\v 5 Now the upper rooms were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middle, in thebuilding. 
\v 6 For they were in three stories, and they didn’t have pillars as the pillars of the courts. Therefore the uppermost was setback more than the lowest and the middle from the ground. 
\v 7 The wall that was outside by the side of the rooms, toward the outer court before the rooms, its length was fifty cubits.
\v 8 For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits. Behold, before the temple were one hundredcubits. 
\v 9 From under these rooms was the entry on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.
\v 10 In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there wererooms. 
\v 11 The way before them was like the appearance of the rooms which were toward the north; according to their length so wastheir width: and all their exits were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
\v 12 According to the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directlybefore the wall toward the east, as one enters into them. 
\v 13 Then he said to me, “The north rooms and the south rooms, which are before the separate place, are the holy rooms, wherethe priests who are near to Yahweh shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most holy things, with the mealoffering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.
\v 14 When the priests enter in, then they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but they shall lay theirgarments in which they minister there; for they are holy. Then they shall put on other garments, and shall approach that whichis for the people.” 
\v 15 Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate which faces toward the east,and measured it all around. 
\v 16 He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed all around.
\v 17 He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed all around.
\v 18 He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
\v 19 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
\v 20 He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, the length five hundred, and the width five hundred, to make aseparation between that which was holy and that which was common.
\c 43 
\v 1 Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east.
\v 2 Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters; and theearth was illuminated with his glory. 
\v 3 It was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came todestroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
\v 4 Yahweh’s glory came into the house by the way of the gate which faces toward the east.
\v 5 The Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, Yahweh’s glory filled the house.
\v 6 I heard one speaking to me out of the house; and a man stood by me.
\v 7 He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwellamong the children of Israel forever. The house of Israel will no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, bytheir prostitution, and by the dead bodies of their kings in their high places;
\v 8 in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door post beside my door post. There was a wall between meand them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed. Therefore I have consumed them inmy anger. 
\v 9 Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me. Then I will dwell among themforever. 
\v 10 “You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let themmeasure the pattern. 
\v 11 If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion, and its exits,and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all its laws; and write it in their sight;that they may keep the whole form of it, and all its ordinances, and do them.
\v 12 “This is the law of the house. On the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most holy. Behold, this isthe law of the house. 
\v 13 “These are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit\f + \fr 43:13 \ft A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46centimeters.\f* is a cubit and a hand width): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the width a cubit, and its border around itsedge a span;\f + \fr 43:13 \ft A span is the length from the tip of a man’s thumb to the tip of his little finger when hishand is stretched out (about half a cubit, or 9 inches, or 22.8 cm.)\f* and this shall be the base of the altar.
\v 14 From the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the width one cubit; and from the lesser ledgeto the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the width a cubit.
\v 15 The upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns.
\v 16 The altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square in its four sides.
\v 17 The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide in its four sides; and the border about it shall be half acubit; and its bottom shall be a cubit around; and its steps shall look toward the east.”
\v 18 He said to me, “Son of man, the Lord Yahweh says: ‘These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they make it, tooffer burnt offerings on it, and to sprinkle blood on it. 
\v 19 You shall give to the Levitical priests who are of the offspring of Zadok, who are near to me, to minister to me,’ saysthe Lord Yahweh, ‘a young bull for a sin offering. 
\v 20 You shall take of its blood, and put it on its four horns, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border allaround. You shall cleanse it and make atonement for it that way.
\v 21 You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, outside ofthe sanctuary. 
\v 22 “On the second day you shall offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, asthey cleansed it with the bull. 
\v 23 When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without defect, and a ram out of the flock withoutdefect. 
\v 24 You shall bring them near to Yahweh, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burntoffering to Yahweh. 
\v 25 “Seven days you shall prepare every day a goat for a sin offering. They shall also prepare a young bull, and a ram out ofthe flock, without defect. 
\v 26 Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it. So shall they consecrate it.
\v 27 When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burntofferings on the altar, and your peace offerings. Then I will accept you,’ says the Lord Yahweh.”
\c 44 
\v 1 Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looks toward the east; and it was shut.
\v 2 Yahweh said to me, “This gate shall be shut. It shall not be opened, no man shall enter in by it; for Yahweh, the God ofIsrael, has entered in by it. Therefore it shall be shut. 
\v 3 As for the prince, he shall sit in it as prince to eat bread before Yahweh. He shall enter by the way of the porch of thegate, and shall go out the same way.” 
\v 4 Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and behold, Yahweh’s glory filled Yahweh’shouse; so I fell on my face. 
\v 5 Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, mark well, and see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I tell you concerningall the ordinances of Yahweh’s house, and all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every exit of thesanctuary. 
\v 6 You shall tell the rebellious, even the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “You house of Israel, let that be enoughof all your abominations, 
\v 7 in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, toprofane it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, to add to all yourabominations. 
\v 8 You have not performed the duty of my holy things; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves.”
\v 9 The Lord Yahweh says, “No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, ofany foreigners who are among the children of Israel. 
\v 10 “‘“But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, they willbear their iniquity. 
\v 11 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house.They shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
\v 12 Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel.Therefore I have lifted up my hand against them,” says the Lord Yahweh, “and they will bear their iniquity.
\v 13 They shall not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to thethings that are most holy; but they will bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
\v 14 Yet I will make them performers of the duty of the house, for all its service, and for all that will be done therein.
\v 15 “‘“But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who performed the duty of my sanctuary when the children of Israel wentastray from me, shall come near to me to minister to me. They shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood,” saysthe Lord Yahweh. 
\v 16 “They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep myinstruction. 
\v 17 “‘“It will be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments. Nowool shall come on them while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.

\v 19 When they go out into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments inwhich they minister, and lay them in the holy rooms. They shall put on other garments, that they not sanctify the people withtheir garments. 
\v 20 “‘“They shall not shave their heads, or allow their locks to grow long. They shall only cut off the hair of their heads.
\v 21 None of the priests shall drink wine when they enter into the inner court.
\v 22 They shall not take for their wives a widow, or her who is put away; but they shall take virgins of the offspring of thehouse of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest. 
\v 23 They shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the uncleanand the clean. 
\v 24 “‘“In a controversy they shall stand to judge. They shall judge it according to my ordinances. They shall keep my lawsand my statutes in all my appointed feasts. They shall make my Sabbaths holy.

\v 26 After he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days.
\v 27 In the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sinoffering,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 28 “‘They shall have an inheritance. I am their inheritance; and you shall give them no possession in Israel. I am theirpossession. 
\v 29 They shall eat the meal offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every devoted thing in Israelshall be theirs.

\v 19 Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy rooms for the priests, whichlooked toward the north. Behold, there was a place on the back part westward.
\v 20 He said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where theyshall bake the meal offering; that they not bring them out into the outer court, to sanctify the people.”
\v 21 Then he brought me out into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in everycorner of the court there was a court. 
\v 22 In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed, fortycubits\f + \fr 46:22 \ft A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18inches or 46 centimeters.\f* long and thirty wide. These four in the corners were the same size.
\v 23 There was a wall around in them, around the four, and boiling places were made under the walls all around.
\v 24 Then he said to me, “These are the boiling houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of thepeople.” 
\c 47 
\v 1 He brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters flowed out from under the threshold of the house eastward,for the front of the house faced toward the east. The waters came down from underneath, from the right side of the house, onthe south of the altar. 
\v 2 Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me around by the way outside to the outer gate, by theway of the gate that looks toward the east. Behold, waters ran out on the right side.
\v 3 When the man went out eastward with the line in his hand, he measured one thousandcubits,\f + \fr 47:3 \ft A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18inches or 46 centimeters.\f* and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.
\v 4 Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measuredone thousand, and caused me to pass through waters that were to the waist.
\v 5 Afterward he measured one thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters had risen, waters toswim in, a river that could not be walked through. 
\v 6 He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen?” Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.
\v 7 Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
\v 8 Then he said to me, “These waters flow out toward the eastern region, and will go down into the Arabah. Then they will gotoward the sea; and flow into the sea which will be made to flow out; and the waters will be healed.
\v 9 It will happen, that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, will live. Then there willbe a very great multitude of fish; for these waters have come there, and the waters of the sea will be healed, and everythingwill live wherever the river comes. 
\v 10 It will happen, that fishermen will stand by it. From En Gedi even to En Eglaim will be a place for the spreading ofnets. Their fish will be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many.
\v 11 But the miry places of it, and its marshes, will not be healed. They will be given up to salt.
\v 12 By the river on its bank, on this side and on that side, will grow every tree for food, whose leaf won’t wither, neitherwill its fruit fail. It will produce new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the sanctuary. Its fruit will befor food, and its leaf for healing.” 
\v 13 The Lord Yahweh says: “This shall be the border, by which you shall divide the land for inheritance according to thetwelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions. 
\v 14 You shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I swore to give it to your fathers. This land will fall to you forinheritance. 
\v 15 “This shall be the border of the land: “On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad;
